tcaboot - Trusted Collective (TC) authority initialization utility

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<tcaboot> I<multicast_group_number_for_TC_bulletins> I<multicast_group_number_for_TC_records> I<number_of_authorities_in_collective> I<K> I<R> [ I<delay> ]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<tcaboot> writes a TC authority administration command file that initializes
a TC authority database.  The file, named "boot.tcarc", is written to the
current working directory.  It simply contains two authority configuration
commands that initialize the TC authority database for the TC application
and then set the initial bulletin compilation time for this authority to
the current ctime plus I<delay> seconds.  If omitted, I<delay> defaults
to 5.  The other command-line arguments for B<tcaboot> are discussed in
the descriptions of application initialization commands for B<tcaadmin>;
see the tcarc(5) manual page for details.
