# Use Cases for ION

## ðŸš€ Current Deployment of ION & ION-Integrated Systems

- **NASA Deep Space Network**: DTN services is currently provided by the DSN.
- **NASA International Space Station**: Science Payload onboard ISS as well as command/telemetry/science data relay Gateway
- **KARI: Korean PathFinder Lunar Orbiter (KPLO)**: Operates a DTN-payload (DTNPL)
- **Morehead State University 21-m Antenna**: operates a ground DTN node using ION
- **ION Core**: a streamlined package of the core DTN features in ION excluding early prototypes and experimental features. Customizable for mission infusion and is available as a separate GitHub [repo.](https://github.com/nasa-jpl/ion-core)
- **F Prime Open Source Flight Software**: ION BPv7 has been integrated with F Prime. A prototype is now available to the public through the [F' Community](https://github.com/fprime-community/fprime-dtn) on GitHub.
