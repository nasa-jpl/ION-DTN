=head1 NAME

amssub - Asynchronous Message Service (AMS) test message receiver for VxWorks

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<amssub> "I<application_name>", "I<authority_name>", "I<subject_name>"

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<amssub> is a message reception program designed to test AMS functionality
in a VxWorks environment.  When an B<amssub> task is started, it registers
as an application module in the root unit of the venture identified by
I<application_name> and I<authority_name>, looks up the subject number for
I<subject_name>, subscribes to that subject, and begins receiving and
printing messages on that subject until terminated by B<amsstop>.

A configuration server for the local continuum and a registrar for the root
unit of the indicated venture (which may both be instantiated in a single
B<amsd> daemon task) must be running in order for B<amssub> to run.

=head1 EXIT STATUS

=over 4

=item -1

B<amssub> terminated with an error as noted in the ion.log file.

=item "0"
