=head1 NAME

amshello - Asynchronous Message Service (AMS) demo program for UNIX

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<amshello>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<amshello> is a sample program designed to demonstrate that an entire
(very simple) distributed AMS application can be written in just a few
lines of C code.  When started, B<amshello> forks a second process and
initiates transmission of a "Hello" text message from one process to the
other, after which both processes unregister and terminate.

The B<amshello> processes will register as application modules in the
root unit of the venture identified by application name "amsdemo" and
authority name "test".  A configuration server for the local continuum
and a registrar for the root unit of that venture (which may both be
instantiated in a single B<amsd> daemon task) must be running in order
for the B<amshello> processes to run.
