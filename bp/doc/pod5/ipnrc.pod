ipnrc - IPN scheme configuration commands file

=head1 DESCRIPTION

IPN scheme configuration commands are passed to B<ipnadmin> either in a file of
text lines or interactively at B<ipnadmin>'s command prompt (:).  Commands
are interpreted line-by line, with exactly one command per line.

IPN scheme configuration commands (a) establish egress plans for direct
transmission to neighboring nodes that are members of endpoints identified
in the "ipn" URI scheme and (b) establish static default routing rules
for forwarding bundles to specified destination nodes.

The egress B<plan> established for a given node associates a default egress
B<duct expression> with that node, and that default duct expression may be
overridden by more narrowly scoped B<planrule>s in specific circumstances:
a different egress duct expression may apply when the source endpoint for
the subject bundle identifies a specific node, a specific service, or both.

Each duct expression is a string of the form
"I<protocol_name>/I<outduct_name>[,I<destination_induct_name>]",
signifying that the bundle is to be queued for transmission via the
indicated convergence layer protocol outduct.  I<destination_induct_name>
must be provided when the indicated outduct is "promiscuous", i.e., not
configured for transmission only to a single neighboring node; this is
protocol-specific.

The circumstances that characterize a specific rule within a general plan
are expressed in a B<qualifier>, a string of the form
"I<source_service_number> I<source_node_number>" where either
I<source_service_number> or I<source_node_number> may be an asterisk
character (*) signifying "all".

Note that egress plans B<must> be established for all neighboring nodes,
regardless of whether or not contact graph routing is used for computing
dynamic routes to distant nodes.  This is by definition: if there isn't
an egress plan to a node, it can't be considered a neighbor.

Static default routes are expressed as B<groups> in the ipn-scheme routing
database.  A group is a range of node numbers identifying a set of nodes
for which defined default routing behavior is established.  Whenever a
bundle is to be forwarded to a node whose number is in the group's node
number range B<and> it has not been possible to compute a dynamic route
to that node from the contact schedules that have been provided to the
local node B<and> that node is not a neighbor to which the bundle can
be directly transmitted, BP will forward the bundle to the B<gateway> node
associated with this group.  The gateway node for any group is identified
by an endpoint ID, which might or might not be an ipn-scheme EID; regardless,
directing a bundle to the gateway for a group causes the bundle to be
re-forwarded to that intermediate destination endpoint.  Multiple groups
may encompass the same node number, in which case the gateway associated
with the most restrictive group (the one with the smallest range) is
always selected.

The formats and effects of the IPN scheme configuration commands are
described below.

=head1 GENERAL COMMANDS

=over 4

=item B<?>

The B<help> command.  This will display a listing of the commands and their
formats.  It is the same as the B<h> command.

=item B<#>

Comment line.  Lines beginning with B<#> are not interpreted.

=item B<e> { 1 | 0 }

Echo control.  Setting echo to 1 causes all output printed by ipnadmin to be
logged as well as sent to stdout.  Setting echo to 0 disables this behavior.

=item B<v> 

Version number.  Prints out the version of ION currently installed.  HINT:
combine with B<e 1> command to log the version number at startup.

=item B<h>

The B<help> command.  This will display a listing of the commands and their
formats.  It is the same as the B<?> command.

=head1 PLAN COMMANDS

=over 4

=item B<a plan> I<node_nbr> I<default_duct_expression>

The B<add plan> command.  This command establishes an egress plan for
the bundles that must be transmitted to the neighboring node identified
by I<node_nbr>.  A general plan must be in place for a node before
any more specific rules are declared.

=item B<c plan> I<node_nbr> I<default_duct_expression>

The B<change plan> command.  This command changes the default duct
expression for the indicated plan.

=item B<d plan> I<node_nbr>

The B<delete plan> command.  This command deletes the egress plan
for the node identified by I<node_nbr>, including all associated rules.

=item B<i plan> I<node_nbr>

This command will print information (the default duct expression and all
specific rules) about the egress plan for the node identified by I<node_nbr>.

=item B<l plan>

This command lists all egress plans established in the IPN database for the
local node.

=back

=head1 PLANRULE COMMANDS

=over 4

=item B<a planrule> I<node_nbr> I<qualifier> I<duct_expression>

The B<add planrule> command.  This command establishes a planrule, i.e., a
duct expression that overrides the default duct expression of the egress
plan for the node identified by I<node_nbr> in the event that the source
endpoint ID of the subject bundle matches I<qualifier>.

=item B<c planrule> I<node_nbr> I<qualifier> I<duct_expression>

The B<change planrule> command.  This command changes the duct expression
for the indicated planrule.

=item B<d planrule> I<node_nbr> I<qualifier>

The B<delete planrule> command.  This command deletes the planrule identified
by I<node_nbr> and I<qualifier>.

=item B<i planrule> I<node_nbr> I<qualifier>

This command will print information (the duct expression) about the planrule
identified by I<node_nbr> and I<qualifier>.

=item B<l planrule> I<node_nbr>

This command lists all planrules in the plan for the indicated node.

=back

=head1 GROUP COMMANDS

=over 4

=item B<a group> I<first_node_nbr> I<last_node_nbr> I<gateway_endpoint_ID>

The B<add group> command.  This command establishes a "group" for static 
default routing as described above.

=item B<c group> I<first_node_nbr> I<last_node_nbr> I<gateway_endpoint_ID>

The B<change group> command.  This command changes the gateway node
number for the group identified by I<first_node_nbr> and I<last_node_nbr> .

=item B<d group> I<first_node_nbr> I<last_node_nbr>

The B<delete group> command.  This command deletes the group identified
by I<first_node_nbr> and I<last_node_nbr>.

=item B<i group> I<first_node_nbr> I<last_node_nbr>

This command will print information (the gateway endpoint ID) about the
group identified by I<first_node_nbr> and I<last_node_nbr>.

=item B<l group>

This command lists all groups defined in the IPN database for the local node.

=head1 GROUPRULE COMMANDS

=over 4

=item B<a grouprule> I<first_node_nbr> I<last_node_nbr> I<qualifier> I<gateway_endpoint_ID>

The B<add grouprule> command.  This command establishes a grouprule, i.e.,
a gateway endpoint ID that overrides the default gateway endpoint ID of the
group identified by I<first_node_nbr> and I<last_node_nbr> in the event
that the source endpoint ID of the subject bundle matches I<qualifier>.

=item B<c grouprule> I<first_node_nbr> I<last_node_nbr> I<qualifier> I<gateway_endpoint_ID>

The B<change grouprule> command.  This command changes the gateway EID
for the indicated grouprule.

=item B<d grouprule> I<first_node_nbr> I<last_node_nbr> I<qualifier>

The B<delete grouprule> command.  This command deletes the grouprule identified
by I<first_node_nbr>, I<last_node_nbr>, and I<qualifier>.

=item B<i grouprule> I<first_node_nbr> I<last_node_nbr> I<qualifier>

identified by I<node_nbr>, I<last_node_nbr>, and I<qualifier>.

=head1 EXAMPLES

=over 4

=item a plan 18 ltp/18

Declares the egress plan to use for transmission from the local node to
neighboring node 18.  Any bundle for which the computed "next hop" node
is node 18 will be queued for transmission on LTP outduct 18.

=item a planrule 18 * 9 ltp/-18

Declares an egress plan override that applies to transmission to node 18
of any bundle whose source is node 9, regardless of the service that was
the source of the bundle.  Each such bundle must be queued for unreliable
transmission on LTP outduct 18 rather than the default (standard transmission
on LTP outduct 18).

=item a group 1 999 dtn://stargate

Declares a default route for bundles destined for all nodes whose numbers
are in the range 1 through 999 inclusive: absent any other routing decision,
such bundles are to be forwarded to "dtn://stargate".
