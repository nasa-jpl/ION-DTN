bpcpd - ION Delay Tolerant Networking remote file copy daemon

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<bpcpd> [-d | -v]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<bpcpd> is the daemon for B<bpcp>. Together these programs copy files between
hosts utilizing NASA JPL's Interplanetary Overlay Network (ION) to provide a
delay tolerant network.

The options are permitted as follows:

=over 4

B< -d>	Debug output. Repeat for increased verbosity.

B< -v>	Display version information.

=back

B<bpcpd> must be running in order to copy files from this host to another host
(i.e. remote to local). Copies in the other direction (local to remote) do not
require B<bpcpd>. Further, B<bpcpd> should NOT be run simultaneously with B<bpcp>
or B<cfdptest>.

=head1 EXIT STATUS

=over 4

=item "0"

B<bpcpd> terminated normally.

=item "1"

B<bpcpd> terminated abnormally. Check console and the B<ion.log> file for error messages.
