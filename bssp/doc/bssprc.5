bssprc \- Bundle Streaming Service Protocol management commands file
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\s-1BSSP\s0 management commands are passed to \fBbsspadmin\fR either in a file of
text lines or interactively at \fBbsspadmin\fR's command prompt (:).  Commands
are interpreted line-by line, with exactly one command per line.  The formats
and effects of the \s-1BSSP\s0 management commands are described below.
.SH "COMMANDS"
.IX Header "COMMANDS"
.IP "\fB?\fR" 4
.IX Item "?"
The \fBhelp\fR command.  This will display a listing of the commands and their
formats.  It is the same as the \fBh\fR command.
.IP "\fB#\fR" 4
.IX Item "#"
Comment line.  Lines beginning with \fB#\fR are not interpreted.
.IP "\fBe\fR { 1 | 0 }" 4
.IX Item "e { 1 | 0 }"
Echo control.  Setting echo to 1 causes all output printed by bsspadmin to be
logged as well as sent to stdout.  Setting echo to 0 disables this behavior.
.IP "\fBv\fR" 4
.IX Item "v"
Version number.  Prints out the version of \s-1ION\s0 currently installed.  \s-1HINT:\s0
combine with \fBe 1\fR command to log the version number at startup.
.IP "\fB1\fR \fIest_max_nbr_of_sessions\fR" 4
.IX Item "1 est_max_nbr_of_sessions"
The \fBinitialize\fR command.  Until this command is executed, \s-1BSSP\s0 is not
in operation on the local \s-1ION\s0 node and most \fIbsspadmin\fR commands will fail.
.Sp
The command uses \fIest_max_nbr_of_sessions\fR to configure the hashtable it
will use to manage access to transmission sessions that are currently
in progress.  For optimum performance, \fIest_max_nbr_of_sessions\fR should
normally equal or exceed the summation of \fImax_nbr_of_sessions\fR over all
spans as discussed below.
.IP "\fBa span\fR \fIpeer_engine_nbr\fR \fImax_nbr_of_sessions\fR \fImax_block_size\fR '\fIBE\-BSO_command\fR' '\fIRL\-BSO_command\fR [\fIqueuing_latency\fR]" 4
.IX Item "a span peer_engine_nbr max_nbr_of_sessions max_block_size 'BE-BSO_command' 'RL-BSO_command [queuing_latency]"
The \fBadd span\fR command.  This command declares that a \fIspan\fR of potential
\&\s-1BSSP\s0 data interchange exists between the local \s-1BSSP\s0 engine and the indicated
(neighboring) \s-1BSSP\s0 engine.
.Sp
The \fImax_block_size\fR is expressed as a number of bytes of data.
\&\fImax_block_size\fR is used to configure transmission buffer sizes; as such, it
limits client data item size. When exceeded, it causes \fBbssp_send()\fR to fail, and
\&\fBbssp_clo()\fR to shutdown. To restart \fBbssp_clo()\fR without rebooting \s-1ION\s0 immediately,
say, due to on-going data transfer over other convergence layers, one can try to first 
stop bpadmin with 'x', then stop bsspadmin with 'x', then run ionrestart to repair
any issue in the volatile database, then relaunch bssp daemon and then bp
daemon using corresponding configuration files. This procedure could temporarily 
enable resumption of operation until it is safe to reboot \s-1ION.\s0
.Sp
\&\fImax_nbr_of_\|_sessions\fR constitutes, in effect, the local \s-1BSSP\s0 engine's
retransmission \*(L"window\*(R" for this span.  The retransmission windows of the
spans impose flow control on \s-1BSSP\s0 transmission, reducing the chance ofx
allocation of all available space in the \s-1ION\s0 node's data store to \s-1BSSP\s0
transmission sessions.
.Sp
\&\fIBE\-BSO_command\fR is script text that will be executed when \s-1BSSP\s0 is started on
this node, to initiate operation of the best-efforts transmission channel task
for this span.  Note that " \fIpeer_engine_nbr\fR" will automatically be
appended to \fIBE\-BSO_command\fR by \fBbsspadmin\fR before the command is executed,
so only the link-service-specific portion of the command should be provided
in the \fILSO_command\fR string itself.
.Sp
\&\fIRL\-BSO_command\fR is script text that will be executed when \s-1BSSP\s0 is started on
this node, to initiate operation of the reliable transmission channel task
for this span.  Note that " \fIpeer_engine_nbr\fR" will automatically be
appended to \fIRL\-BSO_command\fR by \fBbsspadmin\fR before the command is executed,
so only the link-service-specific portion of the command should be provided
in the \fILSO_command\fR string itself.
.Sp
\&\fIqueuing_latency\fR is the estimated number of seconds that we expect to lapse
between reception of a block at this node and transmission of an
acknowledging \s-1PDU,\s0 due to processing delay in the node.  (See the
\&'m ownqtime' command below.)  The default value is 1.
.Sp
If \fIqueuing latency\fR a negative number, the absolute value of this number
is used as the actual queuing latency and session purging is enabled;
otherwise session purging is disabled.  If session purging is enabled
for a span then at the end of any period of transmission over this span
all of the span's export sessions that are currently in progress are
automatically canceled.  Notionally this forces re-forwarding of the \s-1DTN\s0
bundles in each session's block, to avoid having to wait for the restart
of transmission on this span before those bundles can be successfully
transmitted.
.IP "\fBa seat\fR '\fIBE\-BSO_command\fR' '\fIRL\-BSO_command\fR'" 4
.IX Item "a seat 'BE-BSO_command' 'RL-BSO_command'"
The \fBadd seat\fR command.  This command declares that the local \s-1BSSP\s0 engine
can receive \s-1BSSP\s0 PDUs via the link service input daemons that begin
running when '\fIBE\-BSO_command\fR' and '\fIRL\-BSO_command\fR' are executed.
.IP "\fBc span\fR \fIpeer_engine_nbr\fR \fImax_nbr_of_sessions\fR \fImax_block_size\fR '\fIBE\-BSO_command\fR' '\fIRL\-BSO_command\fR [\fIqueuing_latency\fR]" 4
.IX Item "c span peer_engine_nbr max_nbr_of_sessions max_block_size 'BE-BSO_command' 'RL-BSO_command [queuing_latency]"
The \fBchange span\fR command.  This command sets the indicated span's 
configuration parameters to the values provided as arguments.
.IP "\fBd span\fR \fIpeer_engine_nbr\fR" 4
.IX Item "d span peer_engine_nbr"
The \fBdelete span\fR command.  This command deletes the span identified
by \fIpeer_engine_nbr\fR.  The command will fail if any outbound blocks
for this span are pending transmission.
.IP "\fBd seat\fR '\fIBE\-BSO_command\fR' '\fIRL\-BSO_command\fR'" 4
.IX Item "d seat 'BE-BSO_command' 'RL-BSO_command'"
The \fBdelete span\fR command.  This command deletes the seat identified
by '\fIBE\-BSO_command\fR' and '\fIRL\-BSO_command\fR'.
.IP "\fBi span\fR \fIpeer_engine_nbr\fR" 4
.IX Item "i span peer_engine_nbr"
This command will print information (all configuration parameters)
about the span identified by \fIpeer_engine_nbr\fR.
.IP "\fBi seat\fR '\fIBE\-BSO_command\fR' '\fIRL\-BSO_command\fR'" 4
.IX Item "i seat 'BE-BSO_command' 'RL-BSO_command'"
This command will print all information (i.e., process \s-1ID\s0 numbers)
about the seat identified by '\fIBE\-BSO_command\fR' and '\fIRL\-BSO_command\fR'.
.IP "\fBl span\fR" 4
.IX Item "l span"
This command lists all declared \s-1BSSP\s0 data interchange spans.
.IP "\fBl seat\fR" 4
.IX Item "l seat"
This command lists all declared \s-1BSSP\s0 data acquisition seats.
.IP "\fBs\fR ['\fIBE\-BSI_command\fR' '\fIRL\-BSI_command\fR']" 4
.IX Item "s ['BE-BSI_command' 'RL-BSI_command']"
The \fBstart\fR command.  This command starts reliable and best-efforts link
service output tasks for all \s-1BSSP\s0 spans (to remote engines) from the local
\&\s-1BSSP\s0 engine, and it starts the reliable and best-efforts link service input
tasks for the local engine.  '\fIBE\-BSI_command\fR' and '\fIRL\-BSI_command\fR'
are deprecated but are supported for backward compatibility; if provided,
the effect is the same as entering the command 
"a seat '\fIBE\-BSO_command\fR' '\fIRL\-BSO_command\fR'" prior to starting all
daemon tasks.
.IP "\fBm ownqtime\fR \fIown_queuing_latency\fR" 4
.IX Item "m ownqtime own_queuing_latency"
The \fBmanage own queuing time\fR command.  This command sets the number of
seconds of predicted additional latency attributable to processing delay
within the local engine itself that should be included whenever \s-1BSSP\s0 computes
the nominal round-trip time for an exchange of data with any remote engine.
The default value is 1.
.IP "\fBx\fR" 4
.IX Item "x"
The \fBstop\fR command.  This command stops all link service input and output
tasks for the local \s-1BSSP\s0 engine.
.IP "\fBw\fR { 0 | 1 | <activity_spec> }" 4
.IX Item "w { 0 | 1 | <activity_spec> }"
The \fB\s-1BSSP\s0 watch\fR command.  This command enables and disables production of
a continuous stream of user-selected \s-1BSSP\s0 activity indication characters.  A
watch parameter of \*(L"1\*(R" selects all \s-1BSSP\s0 activity indication characters; \*(L"0\*(R"
de-selects all \s-1BSSP\s0 activity indication characters; any other \fIactivity_spec\fR
such as \*(L"\s-1DF\-\*(R"\s0 selects the activity indication characters in the string,
de-selecting all others.  \s-1BSSP\s0 will print each selected activity indication
character to \fBstdout\fR every time a processing event of the associated type
occurs:
.Sp
\&\fBD\fR	bssp send completed
.Sp
\&\fBE\fR	bssp block constructed for issuance
.Sp
\&\fBF\fR	bssp block issued
.Sp
\&\fBG\fR	bssp block popped from best-efforts transmission queue
.Sp

.Sp
\&\fB\-\fR	unacknowledged best-efforts block requeued for reliable transmission
.Sp
\&\fB*\fR	session canceled locally by sender
.IP "\fBh\fR" 4
.IX Item "h"
The \fBhelp\fR command.  This will display a listing of the commands and their
formats.  It is the same as the \fB?\fR command.

.IX Header "EXAMPLES"
.IP "a span 19 20 4096 'udpbso node19.ohio.edu:5001' 'tcpbso node19.ohio.edu:5001'" 4
.IX Item "a span 19 20 4096 'udpbso node19.ohio.edu:5001' 'tcpbso node19.ohio.edu:5001'"
Declares a data interchange span between the local \s-1BSSP\s0 engine and the remote
engine (\s-1ION\s0 node) numbered 19.  There can be at most 20 concurrent sessions
of \s-1BSSP\s0 transmission activity to this node.  Maximum block size for this span
is set to 4096 bytes, and the best-efforts and reliable link service
output tasks that are initiated when \s-1BSSP\s0 is started on the local \s-1ION\s0 node
will execute the \fIudpbso\fR and \fItcpbso\fR programs as indicated.
