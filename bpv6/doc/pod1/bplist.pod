=head1 NAME

bplist - Bundle Protocol (BP) utility for listing queued bundles

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<bplist> [{count | detail} [I<destination_EID>[/I<priority>]]]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<bplist> is a utility program that reports on bundles that currently
reside in the local node, as identified by entries in the local bundle
agent's "timeline" list.

Either a count of bundles or a detailed list of bundles (noting primary block
information together with hex and ASCII dumps of the payload and all
extension blocks, in expiration-time sequence) may be requested.

Either all bundles or just a subset of bundles - restricted to bundles
for a single destination endpoint, or to bundles of a given level of priority
that are all destined for some specified endpoint - may be included in the
report.

By default, B<bplist> prints a detailed list of all bundles residing in
the local node.
