=head1 NAME

bprecvfile - Bundle Protocol (BP) file reception utility

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<bprecvfile> I<own_endpoint_ID> [I<max_files>]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<bprecvfile> is intended to serve as the counterpart to B<bpsendfile>.  It
uses bp_receive() to receive bundles containing file content.  The content
of each bundle is simply written to a file named "testfileN" where N is
the total number of bundles received since the program began running.

If a I<max_files> value of N (where N > 0) is provided, the program will
terminate automatically upon completing its Nth file reception.  Otherwise
it will run indefinitely; use ^C to terminate the program.

=head1 EXIT STATUS

=over 4

=item "0"

B<bprecvfile> has terminated.

=back

=head1 FILES

No configuration files are needed.

=head1 ENVIRONMENT

No environment variables apply.

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

The following diagnostics may be issued to the B<ion.log> log file:

=over 4

=item Can't attach to BP.

B<bpadmin> has not yet initialized BP operations.

=item Can't open own endpoint.

Another BP application task currently has I<own_endpoint_ID> open for
bundle origination and reception.  Try again after that task has terminated.
If no such task exists, it may have crashed while still holding the endpoint
open; the easiest workaround is to select a different source endpoint.

=item bprecvfile bundle reception failed.

BP system error.  Check for earlier diagnostic messages describing the
cause of the error; correct problem and rerun.

=item bprecvfile: can't open test file

File system error.  B<bprecvfile> terminates.

=item bprecvfile: can't receive bundle content.

BP system error.  Check for earlier diagnostic messages describing the
cause of the error; correct problem and rerun.

=item bprecvfile: can't write to test file

File system error.  B<bprecvfile> terminates.

=item bprecvfile cannot continue.

BP system error.  Check for earlier diagnostic messages describing the
cause of the error; correct problem and rerun.

=item bprecvfile: can't handle bundle delivery.

BP system error.  Check for earlier diagnostic messages describing the
cause of the error; correct problem and rerun.
