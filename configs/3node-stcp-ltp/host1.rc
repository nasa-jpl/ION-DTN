#	Ohio University, Oct 2008

# Initialization command (command 1). 
# Establishes the LTP retransmission window. 
# (Prohibiting LTP from seizing all available storage).
#	A maximum of 32 sessions.  A session is assumed to be around one
#	second of transmission.  This value should be estimated at the sum
#	of maximum round-trip times (in seconds) for all "spans."
#	Suggest throwing 20% higher number of sessions to account for extra-
#	long sessions which contain an actual retransmission.
1 32

# Add a span. (a connection) 
#	Identify the span as engine number 1.
#	Use 1400 byte segments (assuming a standard ethernet frame
#	underlying this link and accounting for ip/udp/eth header overhead).
#	Use a nominal block size of 10000 bytes.  This is the amount of data
#	(which can span several bundles) sent in a session.  You should
#	consider this to be the maximum number of bytes sent in one second
#	on the link. (you can also use the block size limit in the
#	initialization command).
#	Use the command 'udplso 10.1.1.1:1113' to implement the link
#	itself.  In this case, we use udp to connect to the local machine
#	(loopback) using port 1113 (defined by IANA as the default UDP port
#	for Licklider Transmission Protocol).  The single quote is
#	important, don't use double quotes.
a span 1 1400 10000 'udplso 10.1.1.1:1113'

# Add another span. (to host2) 
#	Identify the span as engine number 2.
#	Use the command 'udplso 10.1.1.2:1113' to implement the link
#	itself.  In this case, we use udp to connect to host2 using the
#	default port.
a span 2 1400 10000 'udplso 10.1.1.2:1113'

# Start command.
#	This command actually runs the link service output commands
#	(defined above, in the "a span" commands).
#	Also starts the link service INPUT task 'udplsi 10.1.1.1:1113' to
#	listen locally on UDP port 1113 for incoming LTP traffic.

## begin bpadmin 
# bprc configuration file for host1 in a 3node ltp/stcp test.
#	Command: % bpadmin host1.bprc
#	This command should be run AFTER ionadmin and ltpadmin and 
#	BEFORE ipnadmin or dtnadmin.
#
#	Ohio University, Oct 2008

# Initialization command (command 1).
#	Use ipn:1.0 as the custodian endpoint of this node.
#	That is, scheme IPN with element_number 1 and service number 0
#	(ipn requires custodian service is zero).
#	Note that this EID must be understood by the node itself, so be sure
#	to add the scheme below.
1 ipn:1.0

# Add an EID scheme.
#	The scheme's name is ipn.
#	The scheme's number is 1.  Note that this number is defined for
#	Compressed Bundle Header Encoding (CBHE) schemes ONLY.  All other
#	schemes (dtn for example) should use number -1.
#	This scheme's forwarding engine is handled by the program 'ipnfw.'
#	This scheme's administration program (acting as the custodian
#	daemon) is 'ipnadminep.'
a scheme ipn 1 'ipnfw' 'ipnadminep'

# Add endpoints.
#	Establish endpoints ipn:1.0 ipn:1.1 and ipn:1.2 on the local node.
#	ipn:1.0 is expected for custodian traffic.  The rest are usually
#	used for specific applications (such as bpsink).
#	The behavior for receiving a bundle when there is no application
#	currently accepting bundles, is to queue them 'q', as opposed to
#	immediately and silently discarding them (use 'x' instead of 'q' to
#	discard).
a endpoint ipn 1.0 x
a endpoint ipn 1.1 x
a endpoint ipn 1.2 x

# Add a protocol. 
#	Add the protocol named ltp.
#	Estimate transmission capacity assuming 1400 bytes of each frame (in
#	this case, udp on ethernet) for payload, and 100 bytes for overhead.
a protocol ltp 1400 100

# Add an induct. (listen)
#	Add an induct to accept bundles using the ltp protocol.
#	The duct's name is 1 (this is for future changing/deletion of the
#	induct). 
#	The induct itself is implemented by the 'ltpcli' command.
a induct ltp 1 ltpcli

# Add an outduct. (send to yourself)
#	Add an outduct to send bundles using the ltp protocol.
#	The duct's name is 1 (this is for future changing/deletion of the
#	outduct). The name should correspond to a span (in your ltprc).
#	The outduct itself is implemented by the 'ltpclo' command.
a outduct ltp 1 ltpclo
# NOTE:	what happens if 1 does not match the id of an ltp span?

# Add an outduct. (send to host2)
#	Add an outduct to send bundles using the ltp protocol.
#	The duct's name is 2 (this is for future changing/deletion of the
#	outduct). The name should correpsond to a span (in your ltprc).
#	The outduct itself is implemented by the 'ltpclo' command.

#	Essentially, this is the IPN scheme's routing table.
#	Command: % ipnadmin host1.ipnrc
#	This command should be run AFTER bpadmin (likely to be run last).
#
#	Ohio University, Oct 2008

# Add services
#	Add service 0 (i.e. ipn:1.0) called 'admin.'
#	Add service 1 (ipn:1.1) called 'test1.'
#	Add service 2 (ipn:1.2) called 'test2.'
#	See your bprc file for endpoint IDs you should use.
a service 0 admin
a service 1 test1
a service 2 test2

# Add an egress plan.
#	Bundles to be transmitted to element number 1 (that is, yourself).
#	This element is named 'host1.'
#	The plan is to queue for transmission (x) on protocol 'ltp' using
#	the outduct identified as '1.'
#	See your bprc file or bpadmin for outducts/protocols you can use.
a plan 1 host1 x ltp/1

# Add other egress plans.
#	Bundles for elemetn 2 can be transmitted directly to host2 using
#	ltp outduct identified as '2.' See bprc file for available outducts
#	and/or protocols.
a plan 2 host2 x ltp/2

# Add a group static route
#	host 3 is not a neighbor to host1, but it is a neighbor to host2.
#	send bundles for 3 via 2.
