# ltprc configuration file for the loopback test.
#	Command: % ltpadmin loopback.ltprc
#	This command should be run AFTER ionadmin and BEFORE bpadmin.

#	A warning: the ltp configuration is not ideal in this case.
#	please consult manual pages and other documentation for a
#	better description.

# Initialization command (command 1). 
# Establishes the LTP retransmission window. 
# (Prohibiting LTP from seizing all available storage).
#	A maximum of 32 sessions.  A session is assumed to be around one
#	second of transmission.  This value should be estimated at the sum
#	of maximum round-trip times (in seconds) for all "spans."
#	Suggest throwing 20% higher number of sessions to account for extra-
#	long sessions which contain an actual retransmission.
#	Set a total LTP memory space usage limit as the sum of the memory
#	space usage of all spans (more or less the number of bytes in transit
#	on all links for their duration).
1 10 500000

# Add a span. (a connection) 
#	Identify the span as engine number 1.  That is the ipn node number
#	of the node on the other end of this span.
#	Use 2 as the maximum number of export sessions.
#	Use 1024 as the maximum size of an export block.  This more or less
#	limits the maximum size of a bundle in the system.
#	The next two items are the maximum number of import sessions and the
#	maximum size of an imported block. Since this is loopback, we just
#	copy the export numbers here.
#	1024 is the maximum segment size- more or less, the amount of data
#	that can be held in a single frame of the underlying protocol.  In
#	this case, UDP packets are the frame, and we will give a conservative
#	limit.
#	Limit the aggregation size to 1024 bytes, and set a time limit on
#	aggregation to 1 second.
#	Use the command 'aoslso localhost:1113' to implement the link
#	itself.  In this case, we use udp to connect to localhost (this is
#	loopback) using port 1200.  The single quote is
#	important, don't use double quotes.
#
#       tx datarate is set to 750kbits/sec so the 1 megabyte data file will take
#       at least 10 secs, which is how we verify rate limiting works

# Start command.
#	This command actually runs the link service output commands
#	(defined above, in the "a span" commands).
#	Also starts the link service INPUT task 'aoslsi localhost:1113' to
#	listen locally on UDP port 1200 for incoming LTP traffic.
