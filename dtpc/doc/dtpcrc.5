.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\s-1DTPC\s0 management commands are passed to \fBdtpcadmin\fR either in a file of
text lines or interactively at \fBdtpcadmin\fR's command prompt (:).  Commands
are interpreted line-by line, with exactly one command per line.  The formats
and effects of the \s-1DTPC\s0 management commands are described below.
.SH "COMMANDS"
.IX Header "COMMANDS"
.IP "\fB?\fR" 4
.IX Item "?"
The \fBhelp\fR command.  This will display a listing of the commands and their
formats.  It is the same as the \fBh\fR command.
.IP "\fB#\fR" 4
.IX Item "#"
Comment line.  Lines beginning with \fB#\fR are not interpreted.
.IP "\fBe\fR { 1 | 0 }" 4
.IX Item "e { 1 | 0 }"
Echo control.  Setting echo to 1 causes all output printed by dtpcadmin to be
logged as well as sent to stdout.  Setting echo to 0 disables this behavior.
.IP "\fBv\fR" 4
.IX Item "v"
Version number.  Prints out the version of \s-1ION\s0 currently installed.  \s-1HINT:\s0
combine with \fBe 1\fR command to log the version number at startup.
.IP "\fB1\fR" 4
.IX Item "1"
The \fBinitialize\fR command.  Until this command is executed, \s-1DTPC\s0 is not
in operation on the local \s-1ION\s0 node and most \fIdtpcadmin\fR commands will fail.
.IP "\fBa profile\fR \fIprofileID\fR \fImaxRtx\fR \fIaggrSizeLimit\fR \fIaggrTimeLimit\fR \fI\s-1TTL\s0\fR \fIclass_of_service\fR \fIreport_to_endpointID\fR [\fIstatusReportFlags\fR]" 4
.IX Item "a profile profileID maxRtx aggrSizeLimit aggrTimeLimit TTL class_of_service report_to_endpointID [statusReportFlags]"
The \fBadd profile\fR command.  This command notes the definition of a single
\&\s-1DPTC\s0 transmission profile.  A transmission profile asserts the \s-1BP\s0 and \s-1DTPC\s0
configuration parameter values that will be applied to all application
data items (encapsulated in \s-1DTPC\s0 application data units and transmitted in
bundles) that are issued subject to this profile.  Transmission profiles are
globally defined; all transmission profiles must be provided, with identical
parameter values, to all inter-communicating \s-1DTPC\s0 protocol entities.
.Sp
\&\fIprofileID\fR must be the positive integer that uniquely defines the profile.
.Sp
\&\fImaxRtx\fR is the maximum number of times any single \s-1DTPC ADU\s0 transmitted
subject to the indicated profile may be retransmitted by the \s-1DTPC\s0 entity.  If
\&\fImaxRtx\fR is zero, then the \s-1DTPC\s0 transport service features (in-order delivery,
end-to-end acknowledgment, etc.) are disabled for this profile.
.Sp
\&\fIaggrSizeLimit\fR is the size threshold for concluding aggregation of an
outbound \s-1ADU\s0 and requesting transmission of that \s-1ADU.\s0  If \fIaggrSizeLimit\fR is
zero, then the \s-1DTPC\s0 transmission optimization features (aggregation and
elision) are disabled for this profile.
.Sp
\&\fIaggrTimeLimit\fR is the time threshold for concluding aggregation of an
outbound \s-1ADU\s0 and requesting transmission of that \s-1ADU.\s0  If \fIaggrTimeLimit\fR is
zero, then the \s-1DTPC\s0 transmission optimization features (aggregation and
elision) are disabled for this profile.
.Sp
\&\fIclass_of_service\fR is the class-of-service string as defined for \fBbptrace\fR\|(1).
.Sp
\&\fIreport_to_endpointID\fR identifies the \s-1BP\s0 endpoint to which all status
reports generated from bundles transmitted subject to this profile will
be sent.
.Sp
\&\fIstatusReportFlags\fR, if present, must be a sequence of status report flags,
separated by commas, with no embedded whitespace.  Each status report flag
must be one of the following: rcv, ct, fwd, dlv, del.
.IP "\fBd profile\fR \fIprofileId\fR" 4
.IX Item "d profile profileId"
The \fBdelete profile\fR command.  This command erases the definition of the
\&\s-1DTPC\s0 transmission profile identified by \fIprofileId\fR.
.IP "\fBi profile\fR \fIprofileId\fR" 4
.IX Item "i profile profileId"
This command will print information (all configuration parameters)
about the profile identified by \fIprofileId\fR.
.IP "\fBl profile\fR" 4
.IX Item "l profile"
This command lists all known \s-1DTPC\s0 transmission profiles.
.IP "\fBs\fR" 4
.IX Item "s"
The \fBstart\fR command.  This command starts the \s-1DTPC\s0 clock and daemon tasks
for the local \s-1BP\s0 node.
.IP "\fBx\fR" 4
.IX Item "x"
The \fBstop\fR command.  This command stops all \s-1DTPC\s0 tasks and notifies all
\&\s-1DTPC\s0 applications that \s-1DTPC\s0 service has been stopped.
.IP "\fBw\fR { 0 | 1 | <activity_spec> }" 4
.IX Item "w { 0 | 1 | <activity_spec> }"
The \fB\s-1DTPC\s0 watch\fR command.  This command enables and disables production of
a continuous stream of user-selected \s-1DTPC\s0 activity indication characters.  A
watch parameter of \*(L"1\*(R" selects all \s-1DTPC\s0 activity indication characters; \*(L"0\*(R"
de-selects all \s-1DTPC\s0 activity indication characters; any other \fIactivity_spec\fR
such as \*(L"o<r>\*(R" selects all activity indication characters in the string,
de-selecting all others.  \s-1DTPC\s0 will print each selected activity indication
character to \fBstdout\fR every time a processing event of the associated type
occurs:
.Sp
\&\fBo\fR	new aggregator created for profile and destination endpoint
.Sp
\&\fB\e<\fR	new \s-1ADU\s0 aggregation initiated
.Sp
\&\fBr\fR	application data item added to aggregation
.Sp
\&\fB\e\fR>	aggregation complete, outbound \s-1ADU\s0 created
.Sp

.Sp

.Sp
\&\fB*\fR	\s-1ADU\s0 sequence gap deleted due to impending \s-1ADU TTL\s0 expiration
.Sp
\&\fB$\fR	inbound \s-1ADU\s0 collector reset
.IP "\fBh\fR" 4
.IX Item "h"
The \fBhelp\fR command.  This will display a listing of the commands and their
formats.  It is the same as the \fB?\fR command.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.IX Header "EXAMPLES"
.IP "a profile 5 6 1000000 5 3600 0.1 dtn:none" 4
.IX Item "a profile 5 6 1000000 5 3600 0.1 dtn:none"
Notes the definition of \s-1DTPC\s0 transmission profile 5: transport services are
enabled, with an end-to-end retransmission limit of 5; transmission
optimization service is enabled, initiating bundle transmission whenever
the aggregation of data items queued for transmission subject to this
profile exceeds one million bytes or is more than five seconds old; the
transmitted bundles will have one-hour lifetime, will not be subject to
custody transfer, will be sent at \*(L"standard\*(R" priority, and will not be
tracked by any bundle status report production.
