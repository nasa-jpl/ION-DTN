# This test is modeled off of Scott's limbo test.
# The test checks if the tcpcl keepalive backoff timer
# triggers a keepalive when the timer goes off. The 
# timer should trigger a keepalive every 30, 60, 120 seconds....
#
# The test first sends a file over TCPCL, then it shuts down ION
# on node 3 waits for 30 seconds to allow the CL to detect the
# the closed socket.  Then we send a second file while 
# the connection is closed. We then restart ION on node 3 and 
# wait for 30 seconds. When the backoff timer(30 seconds) expires it 
# will re-establish connection and resend the second file. A third
# file is sent from node 2 to node 3 to test restored connectivity.
