# Interplanetary Overlay Network (ION)

## üõ∞Ô∏è ION Description

**Interplanetary Overlay Network (ION)** is an implementation of DTN architecture, as described in Internet RFC 4838 (version 6) and RFC 9171 (version 7), that is intended to be usable in both embedded environments including spacecraft flight computers as well as ground systems. It includes modular software packages implementing Bundle Protocol version 6 (BPv6) and version 7 (BPv7), Licklider Transmission Protocol (LTP), Bundle Streaming Service (BSS), DTN-based CCSDS File Delivery Protocol (CFDP), Asynchronous Message Service (AMS), and several other DTN services and prototypes. ION is currently the baseline implementation for science instruments on the International Space Station (ISS) and the gateway node (ION Gateway) that provides relay services for command/telemetry and science data download.

Here you will find videos of the Interplanetary Overlay Network [courses and presentation materials](https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/heo/scan/engineering/technology/disruption_tolerant_networking_software_options_ion).

DTN Development/Deployment Kit is an ISO image of an Ubuntu virtual machine, pre-configured with ION and a GUI virtualization environment. It contains a number of pre-built scenarios (network topologies) to demonstrate various features of ION software. (** currently the DevKit is undergoing upgrade to BPv7, release date is TBD.**)

## üì° Use Cases for ION

- **Robotics**: This technology enables us to command and control robotic explorers on distant planets and support timely decision-making despite the limitations imposed by vast distances.
- **Satellite Communications**: Our protocol enhances satellite constellations by providing a solution tailored to the unique challenges posed by space communications.
- **Spacecraft Fleets**: Our system can coordinate entire fleets of spacecraft engaged in deep space missions, ensuring synchronized actions and efficient resource use.
- **Interplanetary Internet**: We're laying the foundation for an internet that extends beyond Earth to span across multiple planets, paving the way for universal communication.
- **Space Station Data Handling**: Our technology efficiently manages data transfer between Earth and Space Station's various science payload and instruments, ensuring timely and reliable communications.

## üìä Benchmark Tests

- **BP/LTP Throughput Study**: a comprehensive study of BP/LTP performance on various CPU/OS architecture will be provided in the [ION Deployment Guide](https://github.com/nasa-jpl/ION-DTN/blob/current/doc/ION%20Deployment%20Guide.pdf) after ION 4.1.3 is released. (Current estimated time is Fall of 2023)
