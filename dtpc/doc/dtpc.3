.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
The dtpc library provides functions enabling application software to use
Delay-Tolerant Payload Conditioning (\s-1DTPC\s0) when exchanging information over a
delay-tolerant network.  \s-1DTPC\s0 is an application service protocol, running in
a layer immediately above Bundle Protocol, that offers delay-tolerant support
for several end-to-end services to applications that may require them.  These
services include delivery of application data items in transmission (rather
than reception) order; detection of reception gaps in the sequence of
transmitted application data items, with end-to-end negative acknowledgment
of the missing data; end-to-end positive acknowledgment of successfully
received data; end-to-end retransmission of missing data, driven either by
negative acknowledgment or timer expiration; suppression of duplicate
application data items; aggregation of small application data items into
large bundle payloads, to reduce bundle protocol overhead; and
application-controlled elision of redundant data items in aggregated payloads,
to improve link utiliization.
.IP "int dptc_attach( )" 4
.IX Item "int dptc_attach( )"
Attaches the application to \s-1DTPC\s0 functionality on the local computer.  Returns
0 on success, \-1 on any error.
.IP "void dptc_detach( )" 4
.IX Item "void dptc_detach( )"
Terminates all access to \s-1DTPC\s0 functionality on the local computer.
.IP "int dtpc_entity_is_started( )" 4
.IX Item "int dtpc_entity_is_started( )"
Returns 1 if the local \s-1DTPC\s0 entity has been started and not yet stopped,
0 otherwise.
.IP "int dtpc_open(unsigned int topicID, DtpcElisionFn elisionFn, DtpcSAP *dtpcsapPtr)" 4
.IX Item "int dtpc_open(unsigned int topicID, DtpcElisionFn elisionFn, DtpcSAP *dtpcsapPtr)"
Establishes the application as the sole authorized client for posting and
receiving application data items on topic \fItopicID\fR within the local \s-1BP\s0
node.  On success, the service access point for posting and receiving such
data items is placed in \fI*dtpcsapPtr\fR, the elision callback function
\&\fIelisionFn\fR (if not \s-1NULL\s0) is associated with this topic, and 0 is returned.
Returns \-1 on any error.
.IP "int dtpc_send(unsigned int profileID, DtpcSAP sap, char *destEid, unsigned int maxRtx, unsigned int aggrSizeLimit, unsigned int aggrTimeLimit, int lifespan, BpAncillaryData *ancillaryData, unsigned char srrFlags, BpCustodySwitch custodySwitch, char *reportToEid, int classOfService, Object item, unsigned int length)" 4
.IX Item "int dtpc_send(unsigned int profileID, DtpcSAP sap, char *destEid, unsigned int maxRtx, unsigned int aggrSizeLimit, unsigned int aggrTimeLimit, int lifespan, BpAncillaryData *ancillaryData, unsigned char srrFlags, BpCustodySwitch custodySwitch, char *reportToEid, int classOfService, Object item, unsigned int length)"
Inserts an application data item into an outbound \s-1DTPC\s0 application data unit
destined for \fIdestEid\fR.
.Sp
Transmission of that outbound \s-1ADU\s0 will be subject to the profile identified
by \fIprofileID\fR, as asserted by \fBdtpcadmin\fR\|(1), if \fIprofileID\fR is non-zero.  In
that case, \fImaxRtx\fR, \fIaggrSizeLimit\fR, \fIaggrTimeLimit\fR, \fIlifespan\fR,
\&\fIancillaryData\fR, \fIsrrFlags\fR, \fIcustodySwitch\fR, \fIreportToEid\fR, and
\&\fIclassOfService\fR are ignored.
.Sp
If \fIprofileID\fR is zero then the profile asserted by \fBdtpcadmin\fR\|(1) that matches
\&\fImaxRtx\fR, \fIaggrSizeLimit\fR, \fIaggrTimeLimit\fR, \fIlifespan\fR, \fIancillaryData\fR,
\&\fIsrrFlags\fR, \fIcustodySwitch\fR, \fIreportToEid\fR, and \fIclassOfService\fR will
govern transmission of the \s-1ADU,\s0 unless no such profile has been asserted,
in which case \fBdtpc_send()\fR returns 0 indicating user error.
.Sp
\&\fImaxRtx\fR is the maximum number of times any single \s-1DTPC ADU\s0 transmitted
subject to the indicated profile may be retransmitted by the \s-1DTPC\s0 entity.  If
\&\fImaxRtx\fR is zero, then the \s-1DTPC\s0 transport service features (in-order delivery,
end-to-end acknowledgment, etc.) are disabled for this profile.
.Sp
\&\fIaggrSizeLimit\fR is the size threshold for concluding aggregation of an
outbound \s-1ADU\s0 and requesting transmission of that \s-1ADU.\s0  If \fIaggrSizeLimit\fR is
zero, then the \s-1DTPC\s0 transmission optimization features (aggregation and
elision) are disabled for this profile.
.Sp
\&\fIaggrTimeLimit\fR is the time threshold for concluding aggregation of an
outbound \s-1ADU\s0 and requesting transmission of that \s-1ADU.\s0  If \fIaggrTimeLimit\fR is
zero, then the \s-1DTPC\s0 transmission optimization features (aggregation and
elision) are disabled for this profile.
.Sp
\&\fIlifespan\fR, \fIancillaryData\fR, \fIsrrFlags\fR, \fIcustodySwitch\fR, \fIreportToEid\fR,
and \fIclassOfService\fR are as defined for bp_send (see \fBbp\fR\|(3)).
.Sp
\&\fIitem\fR must be an object allocated within \s-1ION\s0's \s-1SDR\s0 \*(L"heap\*(R", and \fIlength\fR
must be the length of that object.  The item will be inserted into the outbound
\&\s-1ADU\s0's list of data items posted for the topic associated with \fIsap\fR, and
the elision callback function declared for \fIsap\fR (if any, and if the
applicable profile does not disable transmission optimization features)
will be invoked immediately after insertion of the application data item
but before \s-1DTPC\s0 makes any decision on whether or not to initiate transmission
of the outbound \s-1ADU.\s0
.Sp
The function returns 1 on success, 0 on any user application error, \-1 on
any system error.
.IP "int dtpc_receive(DtpcSAP sap, DtpcDelivery *dlvBuffer, int timeoutSeconds)" 4
.IX Item "int dtpc_receive(DtpcSAP sap, DtpcDelivery *dlvBuffer, int timeoutSeconds)"
Receives a single \s-1DTPC\s0 application data item, or reports on some failure of
\&\s-1DTPC\s0 reception activity.
.Sp
The \*(L"result\*(R" field of the dlvBuffer structure will be used to indicate the
outcome of the data reception activity.
.Sp
If at least one application data item on the topic associated with \fIsap\fR
has not yet been delivered to the \s-1SAP,\s0 then the payload of the oldest such
item will be returned in \fIdlvBuffer\fR\->\fIitem\fR and \fIdlvBuffer\fR\->\fIresult\fR
will be set to PayloadPresent.  If there is no such item, \fBdtpc_receive()\fR
blocks for up to \fItimeoutSeconds\fR while waiting for one to arrive.
.Sp
If \fItimeoutSeconds\fR is \s-1DTPC_POLL\s0 (i.e., zero) and no application data item is
awaiting delivery, or if \fItimeoutSeconds\fR is greater than zero but no item
arrives before \fItimeoutSeconds\fR have elapsed, then \fIdlvBuffer\fR\->\fIresult\fR
will be set to ReceptionTimedOut.  If \fItimeoutSeconds\fR is \s-1DTPC_BLOCKING\s0
(i.e., \-1) then \fBbp_receive()\fR blocks until either an item arrives or the
function is interrupted by an invocation of \fBdtpc_interrupt()\fR.
.Sp
\&\fIdlvBuffer\fR\->\fIresult\fR will be set to ReceptionInterrupted in the event
that the calling process received and handled some signal other than \s-1SIGALRM\s0
while waiting for a bundle.
.Sp
\&\fIdlvBuffer\fR\->\fIresult\fR will be set to DtpcServiceStopped in the event
that \s-1DTPC\s0 service has been terminated on the local node.
.Sp
The application data item delivered in the \s-1DTPC\s0 delivery structure, if
any, will be an object allocated within \s-1ION\s0's \s-1SDR\s0 \*(L"heap\*(R"; the length of
that object will likewise be provided in the DtpcDelivery structure.
.Sp
Be sure to call \fBdtpc_release_delivery()\fR after every successful invocation of
\&\fBdtpc_receive()\fR.
.Sp
The function returns 0 on success, \-1 on any error.
.IP "void dtpc_interrupt(DtpcSAP sap)" 4
.IX Item "void dtpc_interrupt(DtpcSAP sap)"
Interrupts a \fBdtpc_receive()\fR invocation that is currently blocked.  This
function is designed to be called from a signal handler; for this purpose,
\&\fIsap\fR may need to be obtained from a static variable.
.IP "void dtpc_release_delivery(DtpcDelivery *dlvBuffer)" 4
.IX Item "void dtpc_release_delivery(DtpcDelivery *dlvBuffer)"
Releases resources allocated to the indicated \s-1DTPC\s0 delivery.
.IP "void dtpc_close(DtpcSAP sap)" 4
.IX Item "void dtpc_close(DtpcSAP sap)"
Removes the application as the sole authorized client for posting and
receiving application data items on the topic indicated in \fIsap\fR within the
local \s-1BP\s0 node.  The application relinquishes its ability to send and
receive application data items on the indicated topic.
