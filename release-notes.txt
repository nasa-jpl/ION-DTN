September 29, 2011

%%%%%%%%%%%
= GENERAL =
%%%%%%%%%%%

The ION (interplanetary overlay network) software is a suite of communication
protocol implementations designed to support mission operation communications
across an end-to-end interplanetary network, which might include on-board
(flight) subnets, in-situ planetary or lunar networks, proximity links, deep
space links, and terrestrial internets.  Included in the ION software
distribution are the following packages:

- ici (interplanetary communication infrastructure), a set of libraries
  that provide flight-software-compatible support for functions on which
  the other packages rely, such as dynamic memory management, non-volatile
  storage management, and inter-task communication via shared memory.
  The ici libraries are designed to make the porting of IPN software to
  multiple operating systems - Linux, VxWorks, Solaris, etc. - as easy as
  possible. Ici now includes zco (zero-copy object), a library that 
  minimizes the copying of application data as it is encapsulated in 
  multiple layers of protocol structure while traversing the protocol
  stack.

- bp (bundle protocol), an implementation of the Delay-Tolerant
  Networking (DTN) architecture's Bundle Protocol.

- ltp (licklider transmission protocol), a DTN convergence layer for
  reliable transmission over links characterized by long or highly
  variable delay.

- dgr (datagram retransmission), an alternative implementation of ltp
  that is designed for use over the Internet protocol stack.  dgr
  implements congestion control and is designed for relatively high
  performance.

- ams - an implementation of the CCSDS Asynchronous Message Service.

- cfdp - a class-1 (Unacknowledged) implementation of the CCSDS File
  Delivery Protocol.


Features included:

- cgr - Contract graph routing: a method of dynamic routing designed for
  space based applications of ION, but still usable for terrestrial
  applications. It computes routes using scheduled communication and deals
  with time-varying network topology.

- brs - Bundle relay service: provides interconnectivity between networks
  that do not allow servers (those behind NAT for example). For more
  information, check man brsscla and man brsccla.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

- Issue #185: ION now supports binding to INADDR_ANY in UDP/TCP ports and link
  service adapters.

- Issue #298: Code scrub to remove unused variable warnings that prevent
  compilation of ION under the default settings of gcc 4.6.1.

- Issue #310: Fixed broken Windows support.  Fixed several minor issues.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
= NOTES ON RELEASE 2.5.0 =
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

- Issue #189/#250/#252: ION shutdown utility added.

- Issue #196: The congestion checking subroutines have been implemented more
  efficiently.

- Issue #265: The "bpdriver" application now allows users to set the TTL value
  dynamically via a the "t<ttl>" command line parameter.

- Issue #276: Loopback range can now be set to a non-zero value.

- Issue #279: Fixed issue where calling bpMemo twice created timeline events
  that could not be removed.

- Issue #286: Fixed issue where erroneous input to several administrative
  applications could cause them to crash.

- Issue #292: Fixed issue where pid-checking routines can give false-negatives
  for vxworks processes.

  they are only used with invariant values.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
= NOTES ON RELEASE 2.4.2 =
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
 
- Issue #264: Removed checks for maximum block size in LTP, simplifying LTP
  configuration and fixing a bug.
  Related to the fix for issue #293, upgrading the LTP configuration worksheet.

- Issue #269: Clean up platform (portability) files, making it easier to add
  new ports.

  switch from being set.

- Issue #275: ION now has support for code coverage analysis via lcov/gcov.
  To enable this feature, use "--configure --with-gcov".
  Building with code coverage support enables the following new directives:
     make cov: creates a "coverage" subfolder from the top of the ION
               directory where HTML coverage results are stored
     make cov clean: removes the trace files and the "coverage" subdirectory

  to write to a file without sufficient write permissions.

- Issue #282: Fixed issue where LTP segments received outside of a contact
  were mishandled.

- Issue #283: Fixed issue where the CFDP FDU didn't load the database before
  using it, resulting in erroneous data being fed into the CFDP event queue.

- Issue #284: Fixed issue where CFDP mishandled extent merges, resulting
  in checksum failures.

- Issue #285: Fixed issue in cfdpadmin where malformed commands could cause the
  application to crash.

- Issue #287: Fixed issue that prevented the reporting of user messages and
  filestore responses in cfdptest.

  doesn't account for a small aggregation size limit when calculating
  export blocks

- Issue #295: ION's internal contact graph routing routines have been
  parameterized to enable better support for deployment-specific variations
  of the algorithm.

- ION now has native Windows support via MingW.  
  Support for Cygwin and Interix has been removed.

- Added support for inactivity timer in CFDP.

- Fixed race conditions in support for multithreaded AMS.

- Fixed memory leaks in AMS shutdown.

- Added ability to update AMS modules’ management information bases while the
  modules are running, by using the new amsmib utility.  Modified amsstop to
  use a similar mechanism.

- Added AMS Programmer’s Guide to distribution.

- Various minor bug fixes.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
= NOTES ON RELEASE 2.4.1 =
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

- Issue #240: Added DCCP link service adapters to ION for the purpose of 
  providing congestion control without reliability guarantees, which is
  beneficial for LTP deployments over IP networks, particularly when traversing
  the Internet. The sender program is called "dccplso" and the receiver program
  is called "dccplsi".

- Issue #241: Added DCCP convergence layer for BP. The sender program is called
  "dccpclo" and the receiver program is called "dccpcli".

- Issue #245: Added support for using the character "*" as a wildcard to remove
  multiple contacts and ranges at once.

- Issue #257: Fixed issue where bundles would remain in the limbo queue after
  an outduct was blocked rather than be reforwarded.

- Issue #263: Fixed issue with pthread_t.  pthread_t is now treated as an
  opaque type for the purpose of improving code correctness and portability.

- Issue #273: Added a ".hgignore" file that can be populated with regular
  expressions of files to suppress when the "hg status" command is run.

- Issue #277: Fixed 3-node-stcp-ltp configuration to remove an unintentional
  connection between nodes 1 and 3.

- Issue #278: Updated various test configuration files to have more recent
  contact times.

- Tests have been scrubbed to adopt the new security syntax enhancements
  introduced in Issue #247.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
= NOTES ON RELEASE 2.4.0 =
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

- Issue 105: Add correlation blocks to the bundle protocol block extension
  interface.

- Issue 106: Extract bundle block-related functionality into separate source .c
  and .h files to allow for future modular development of block extensions.

- Issue 161: Corrected some redundant and/or circular library linking when
  using autotools.

- Issue 176: Upgrade ltp-cla to better conform to current ltpcla draft in the
  DTNRG.  Particularly the new "green" service handling.

- Issue 195: sm_SemUnwedge() in platform_sm.c uses a pthread to ensure a
  semaphore is not already taken.  Some platforms do not include pthreads and
  the function can be implemented using semaphore trywait semantics().

- Issue 233: Some additional LTP debugging hooks added.

- Issue 238: Fixed possible leak of custodianEid in sendCtSignal.

- Issue 247: Updating the syntax of ionsecadmin for flexibility and readability.

- Issue 248: Fixed a timeline ordering bug in LTP.

- Issue 249: Added support to ION's LTP for section 6.21 of RFC 5326, the LTP
  specification.  Specifically detecting "red" and "green" segments that
  overlap: an error-state.

- Issue 253: Fixed a tcpcl bug: When connection is lost to a node, a keepalive
  needs to be at the end of the backoff period. TCPCL waits backoff period +
  keepalive period to send the keepalive.

- Issue 254: Fixed LTP report serial number bug.

- Issue 255: Fixed bug where pseudoshell can cause duplicate parent processes.

- Issue 256: Fixed uninitialized memory read in reverseEnqueue().

- Issue 258: ZCO referenced file progress.

- Issue 260: Teach memcheck about MTAKE/MRELEASE for improved testing using
  valgrind.

- Various bugfixes and features for CFDP package.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
= NOTES ON RELEASE 2.3.0 =
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

- Modified administrative startup commands to block until startup is complete,
  rather than return immediately even if the node hasn't been fully initialized.

- Fixed a bug which truncated dtn-scheme bundle source EIDs.

- Modified some tests (1000.loopback) to run compiled objects instead of shell
  scripts.  This eliminates the need for shell scripting and allows automated
  tests to function on platforms without shell access.

- Combined similar test configurations to use the shared /configs directory.
  This will provide a standard set of updated configurations.

- Test suite has been modified to support multiple test sets.  Creating a
  text file in the tests directory containing a list of tests is all that
  is needed to create a test set.
  Examples: make test-all ; make test-branch ; make test-<anything>

- Added "limbo" queue to support suspension and resumption.  This allows the
  node to handle unexpected convergence layer failure as opposed to scheduled
  or static contact termination.

- Code scrub of DGR.

- Added bping, bpchat, and bpstats2 utilities.

- Custody transfer is now optional in both bptrace and bpsend.

- Added feature for "convergence-layer stewardship"; CL's can initiate
  reforwarding of bundles on transmission failure without explicit
  bundle-layer custodianship.

- Enhanced LTP's udplso with a transmission rate limiter.

- Added new AOS CLA for LTP.

- Bug fixes to: LTP, CGR, SDR mutex, bpcounter, ionscript, tcpcl, stcp,
  PSM mutex, SDR, bpsink, and others.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
= NOTES ON RELEASE 2.2.1 =
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

- Corrected bug in LTP's data acquisition into file-system storage.  Didn't
  handle data loss and retransmission properly.

- Fixed bugs in LTP session cancellation that caused slow storage leaks.

- Upgraded the LTP configuration spreadsheet and its documentation, to
  provide better guidance when most data are sent from or acquired into
  file system storage.

- Updated the Design and Operations Guide to document new features and
  API changes.

- Various other bug fixes and tweaks.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
= NOTES ON RELEASE 2.2.0 =

- Various testing applications in earlier releases are split from the ion release.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
= NOTES ON RELEASE 1.1.0 =
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

- Based on JPL revision 226.

- Experimental new tcp convergence layer compatible with the standard defined
  by draft-irtf-dtnrg-tcp-clayer-02.  This convergence layer is titled tcp,
  with other programs tcpcli tcpclo, and is suitable for connectivity with the
  DTN2 reference implementation.  Currently only unidirectional, unacknowledged
  communication is supported.  Some bugs still present.

- ION-specific tcp-based convergence layer is renamed stcp (stcpcli stcpclo)
  and still functions as expected.

- Adds user-contributed applications bping bping bpmon bpalive.

- some LTP related bugs are not yet squashed.

- Updates to various user-contrib programs; added a bpmon_query program to work
  with SNMP.

- Revise LTP to use randomly selected session numbers rather than recycling small
  session numbers - prevent data loss and corruption due to application of late-
  arriving segments to sessions that are re-using the session numbers of earlier
  sessions.

- added the bplive program.

- Updated for sbp_api.h and abp_api.c

- brought over basic working draft-tcpcl standards-compliant code with help of
  patch submitted by Andrew.Jenkins@colorado.edu

- manually applied patches from seb@highlab.com, adding sanity-checks and more
  consistent comment-line detection to the admin programs

- Add fixes to eliminate compiler warnings, per Ohio U.  Remove all ppc-vxworks
  makefile directories, replacing them with arch-vxworks5 directories because
  the VxWorks build varies with VxWorks version number and not with the hardware
  platform that you build for.  Add "expat", which is needed by AMS and is not
  provided with VxWorks.  Fix segfault bug in dtnfw reported by U. of Colorado.
  Fix bug in support for trackingElts list.

- applied the patch from Andrew.Jenkins@colorado.edu about dtnfw's rule/plan but

- added new ION.pdf to the in-development release

- overhauled ionstart, ionscript, ionstart.awk to account for the dtnadmin need for
  a node name as well as the bpadmin/dtnadmin/ipnadmin startup order bug found by
  Andrew.Jenkins@colorado.edu

- Revise routing to match applicable backlog (based on bundle's priority; not
  necessarily total backlog) against aggregate capacity when determining route
  viability.  (Per JIRA item DINET-107)  Add implementation of extension block
  for extended class of service, which includes an additional 256 "ordinal"
  priority sub-levels within priority 2.

- Upgrade AMS implementation to Red Book 2.

- Add interface for inserting BP extensions.

  Ubuntu 7.04, 7.10, 8.04, Gentoo, Fedora 3, Fedora 7, OSX 10.5, and Solaris 10.

- Killm updated to work on OSX 10.4, due to an ipcs incompatibility; also
  updated to make sure all processes are killed.

- Removed multiple compiler warnings.

- Includes bundle relay programs brsscla and brsccla; brsscla acts as the
  server, brsccla acts as the client.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
= NOTES ON RELEASE 0.2 =
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

- The ion package, which implements the DTN Bundle Protocol (BP), has been
  upgraded to conform to BP version 5, submitted to IETF in December 2006.
  The changes are almost exclusively internal to the software and protocol:
  the format of bundles exchanged through the delay-tolerant network is altered,
  but the API for ION is mostly unchanged.  Note that this release of ION is
  not interoperable with implementations of BP version 4.

- The Remote AMS functionality of AMS has been upgraded to conform to the
  specification most recently posted to the public documents list of the CCSDS
  CWE site for AMS.  The API for AMS is unchanged.
