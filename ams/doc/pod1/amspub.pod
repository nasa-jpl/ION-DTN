=head1 NAME

amspub - Asynchronous Message Service (AMS) test driver for VxWorks

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<amspub> "I<application_name>", "I<authority_name>", "I<subject_name>", "I<message_text>"

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<amspub> is a message publication program designed to test AMS functionality
in a VxWorks environment.  When an B<amspub> task is started, it registers
as an application module in the root unit of the venture identified by
I<application_name> and I<authority_name>, looks up the subject number for
I<subject_name>, publishes a single message with content I<message_text> on
that subject, unregisters, and terminates.

A configuration server for the local continuum and a registrar for the root
unit of the indicated venture (which may both be instantiated in a single
B<amsd> daemon task) must be running in order for B<amspub> to run.
