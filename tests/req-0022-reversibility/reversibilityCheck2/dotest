# This test verifies that ion recovery is functional. This test starts two nodes
# and sends bundles from one to the other until that second node fills up. Then  
# bpcrash is used to simulate a crash on the second node by forcing a transaction
# cancellation. This is likely not to require transaction reversal. But it will trigger
# a reloading of ION and BP protocol volatile state information to be reloaded. Then
# the ion and bp daemons will be restarted. After allowing for bundles prior to the crash
# to expire - one could also actually drain them by using bpcounter - then we confirm
# the receiving node (node 2) is again back in a state where it can receive bundles.
# The test is a success if the new bundles sent from node 1 is received in node 2.

function end(){
# Shut down ION.
