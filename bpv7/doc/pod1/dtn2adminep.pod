=head1 NAME

dtn2adminep - administrative endpoint task for the "dtn" scheme

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<dtn2adminep>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<dtn2adminep> is a background "daemon" task that receives and processes
administrative bundles (minimally, all bundle status reports) that are
sent to the "dtn"-scheme administrative endpoint on the local ION node,
if and only if such an endpoint was established by B<bpadmin>.  It is
spawned automatically by B<bpadmin> in response to the 's' (START)
command that starts operation of Bundle Protocol on the local
ION node, and it is terminated by B<bpadmin> in response to an 'x' (STOP)
command.  B<dtn2adminep> can also be spawned and terminated in response to
START and STOP commands that pertain specifically to the "dtn" scheme.

B<dtn2adminep> responds to bundle status reports by logging ASCII text
messages describing the reported activity.

=head1 EXIT STATUS

=over 4

=item "0"

B<dtn2adminep> terminated, for reasons noted in the B<ion.log> file.  If this
termination was not commanded, investigate and solve the problem identified
in the log file and use B<bpadmin> to restart B<dtn2adminep>.

=item "1"

B<dtn2adminep> was unable to attach to Bundle Protocol operations or was
unable to load the "dtn" scheme database, probably because B<bpadmin> has
not yet been run.
