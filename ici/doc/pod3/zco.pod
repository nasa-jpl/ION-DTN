=head1 DESCRIPTION

"Zero-copy objects" (ZCOs) are abstract data access representations
designed to minimize I/O in the encapsulation of application source
data within one or more layers of communication protocol structure.  ZCOs
are constructed within the heap space of an SDR to which implementations
of all layers of the stack must have access.  Each ZCO contains information
enabling access to the source data object, together with (a) a linked list
of zero or more "extents" that reference portions of this source data
object and (b) linked lists of protocol header and trailer capsules.  The
concatenation of the headers (in ascending stack sequence), source data
object extents, and trailers (in descending stack sequence) is what is to
be transmitted.

The source data object may be either a file (identified by pathname
stored in a "file reference" object in SDR heap) or an array of bytes
in SDR heap space (identified by SDR address).  Each protocol header
or trailer capsule indicates the length and the address (within SDR
heap space) of a single protocol header or trailer at some layer of the stack.

ZCOs are not directly exposed to applications.  Instead, applications
operate on ZcoReferences; multiple ZcoReferences may, invisibly to
the applications, refer to the same ZCO.  When the last reference to
a given ZCO is destroyed -- either explicitly or (when the entire
ZCO has been read and copied via this reference) implicitly -- the
ZCO itself is automatically destroyed.

Note that the safety of shared access to a ZCO is protected by the
fact that the ZCO resides in SDR and therefore cannot be modified
other than in the course of an SDR transaction, which serializes
access.  Note also that "transmitting" or "receiving" a ZCO updates
progress counters in the ZCO reference object and therefore is an
SDR data modification that must occur in the course of an SDR
transaction.

Note also that ZCO can more broadly be used as a general-purpose
reference counting system for non-volatile data objects, where a
need for such a system is identified.

=item Object zco_create_file_ref(Sdr sdr, char *pathName, char *cleanupScript)

Creates and returns a new file reference object, which can be used as the
source data extent location for creating a ZCO whose source data object is
the file identified by I<pathName>.  I<cleanupScript>, if not NULL, is invoked
at the moment the last ZCO that cites this file reference is destroyed
[normally upon delivery either down to the "ZCO transition layer" of the
protocol stack or up to a ZCO-capable application].  A zero-length string
is interpreted as implicit direction to delete the referenced file when
the file reference object is destroyed.  Maximum length of I<cleanupScript>
is 255.  Returns SDR location of file reference object on success, 0 on any
error.

=item Object zco_revise_file_ref(Sdr sdr, Object fileRef, char *pathName, char *cleanupScript)

Changes the I<pathName> and I<cleanupScript> of the indicated file
reference.  The new values of these fields are validated as for
zco_create_file_ref().  Returns 0 on success, -1 on any error.

=item char *zco_file_ref_path(Sdr sdr, Object fileRef, char *buffer, int buflen)

Retrieves the pathName associated with I<fileRef> and stores it in I<buffer>,
truncating it to fit (as indicated by I<buflen>) and NULL-terminating it.  On
success, returns I<buffer>; returns NULL on any error.

=item unsigned int zco_file_ref_occupancy(Sdr sdr, Object fileRef)

Returns the number of bytes of SDR heap space occupied by the ZCO file
reference object identified by I<fileRef>.  If I<fileRef> is zero,
returns the maximum possible SDR space occupancy of any single file
reference object.

=item int zco_file_ref_xmit_eof(Sdr sdr, Object fileRef)

Returns 1 if the last octet of the referenced file (as determined at the
time the file reference object was created) has been read by ZCO via a
reader with file offset tracking turned on.  Otherwise returns zero.

=item void zco_destroy_file_ref(Sdr sdr, Object fileRef)

If the file reference object residing at location I<fileRef> within
the indicated Sdr is no longer in use (no longer referenced by any ZCO),
destroys this file reference object immediately.  Otherwise, flags this
file reference object for destruction as soon as the last reference to
it is removed.

=item Object zco_create(Sdr sdr, ZcoMedium firstExtentSourceMedium, Object firstExtentLocation, unsigned int firstExtentOffset, unsigned int firstExtentLength)

Creates a new ZCO.  I<firstExtentLocation> and I<firstExtentLength>
must either both be zero (indicating that zco_append_extent() will be used to
insert the first source data extent later) or else both be non-zero.
If I<firstExtentLocation> is non-zero, then (a) I<firstExtentLocation> must
be the SDR location of a file reference object if I<firstExtentSourceMedium> is
ZcoFileSource and must otherwise be the SDR location of the source data itself,
and (b) I<firstExtentOffset> indicates how many leading bytes of the source
data object should be skipped over when adding the initial source data extent
to the new ZCO.  On success, returns the SDR location of the first reference
to the new ZCO.  Returns 0 on any error.

=item int zco_append_extent(Sdr sdr, Object zcoRef, ZcoMedium sourceMedium, Object location, unsigned int offset, unsigned int length)

Appends the indicated source data extent to the indicated ZCO, as described
for zco_create().  Both the I<location> and I<length> of the source data
must be non-zero.  Returns 0 on success, -1 on any error.

=item int zco_prepend_header(Sdr sdr, Object zcoRef, char *header, unsigned int length)

=item int zco_append_trailer(Sdr sdr, Object zcoRef, char *trailer, unsigned int length)

=item void zco_discard_first_header(Sdr sdr, Object zcoRef)

=item void zco_discard_last_trailer(Sdr sdr, Object zcoRef)

These functions attach and remove the ZCO's headers and trailers.  I<header>
and I<trailer> are assumed to be arrays of octets, not necessarily text.  
Attaching a header or trailer causes it to be written to the SDR.  The
prepend and append functions return 0 on success, -1 on any error.

=item Object zco_add_reference(Sdr sdr, Object zcoRef)

Creates an additional reference to the referenced ZCO and adds 1 to that
ZCO's reference count.  Returns SDR location of the new ZcoReference on
success, 0 on any error.

=item void zco_destroy_reference(Sdr sdr, Object zcoRef)

Explicitly destroys the indicated Zco reference.  When the ZCO's last
reference is destroyed, the ZCO itself is automatically destroyed.

=item Object zco_clone(Sdr sdr, Object zcoRef, unsigned int offset, unsigned int length)

Creates a new ZCO that is a copy of a subset of the referenced ZCO.  Copies
portions of the extents of the original ZCO as necessary.  Returns SDR
location of a new ZcoReference to the new ZCO on success, 0 on any error.

=item unsigned int zco_length(Sdr sdr, Object zcoRef)

Returns length of entire ZCO, including all headers and trailers and
all source data extents.  This is the size of the object that would be
formed by concatenating the text of all headers, trailers, and source
data extents into a single serialized object.

=item unsigned int zco_source_data_length(Sdr sdr, Object zcoRef)

Returns length of entire ZCO minus the lengths of all attached headers and
trailers.  This is the size of the object that would be formed by
concatenating the text of all source data extents into a single
serialized object.

=item unsigned int zco_occupancy(Sdr sdr, Object zcoRef)

Returns the number of bytes of SDR heap space occupied by the ZCO identified
by I<zcoRef>, plus the size of this reference to that ZCO.  It includes the
sizes of the ZCO, ZCO header/trailer capsule, and ZCO extent objects
themselves, and it B<omits> the sizes of all source data extents that do not
occupy SDR heap space (i.e., ones that reside in files to which ZCO extent
objects refer).

=item unsigned int zco_nbr_of_refs(Sdr sdr, Object zcoRef)

Returns the number of ZCO reference objects that currently refer to the
ZCO identified by I<zcoRef>.

=item void zco_start_transmitting(Sdr sdr, Object zcoRef, ZcoReader *reader)

Used by underlying protocol layer to start extraction of an outbound ZCO's
bytes (both from header and trailer capsules and from source data extents) for
"transmission" -- i.e., the copying of bytes into a memory buffer for
delivery to some non-ZCO-aware protocol implementation.  Initializes
reading after the last byte of the total concatenated ZCO object that
has already been read via this ZCO reference, if any.  Populates I<reader>,
which is used to keep track of "transmission" progress via this ZCO reference.

=item void zco_track_file_offset(ZcoReader *reader)

Turns on file offset tracking for this reader.

=item int zco_transmit(Sdr sdr, ZcoReader *reader, unsigned int length, char *buffer)

Copies I<length> as-yet-uncopied bytes of the total concatenated ZCO
(referenced by I<reader>) into I<buffer>.  If I<buffer> is NULL, skips
over I<length> bytes without copying.  Returns the number of bytes copied
(or skipped) on success, 0 on any file access error, -1 on any other error.

=item void zco_stop_transmitting(Sdr sdr, ZcoReader *reader)

Terminates extraction of this outbound ZCO's bytes for transmission.

=item void zco_start_receiving(Sdr sdr, Object zcoRef, ZcoReader *reader)

Used by overlying protocol layer to start extraction of an inbound ZCO's
bytes for "reception" -- i.e., the copying of bytes into a memory buffer
for delivery to a protocol header parser, to a protocol trailer parser,
or to the ultimate recipient (application).  Initializes reading of
headers, source data, and trailers after the last byte of such content
that has already been read via this ZCO reference, if any.  Populates
I<reader>, which is used to keep track of "reception" progress via this
ZCO reference.

=item int zco_receive_headers(Sdr sdr, ZcoReader *reader, unsigned int length, char *buffer)

Copies I<length> as-yet-uncopied bytes of header data from ZCO extents into
I<buffer>, advancing the presumptive start of actual source data (and
increasing the presumptive length of the ZCO's concatenated protocol
headers) by I<length>.  If I<buffer> is NULL, skips over I<length> bytes
without copying.  Returns number of bytes copied (or skipped) on success,
0 on any file access error, -1 on any other error.

=item void zco_restore_source(Sdr sdr, ZcoReader *reader, unsigned int length)

Backs off the presumptive start of actual source data in the ZCO, i.e.,
reduces by I<length> the presumptive length of the ZCO's concatenated
protocol headers and thereby increases the presumptive length of the ZCO's
actual source data.  Use this function to readjust internal boundaries within
the ZCO when the trailing I<length> bytes of data previously read as
presumptive protocol header data are determined instead to be source data.

=item void zco_delimit_source(Sdr sdr, ZcoReader *reader, unsigned int length)

Sets the presumptive length of actual source data in the ZCO to I<length>,
thereby establishing the offset from the start of the ZCO at which the
innermost protocol trailer begins.  Use this function to establish the
location of the ZCO's innermost trailer, based on total source data
length as determined from the contents of the innermost protocol header.

=item int zco_receive_source(Sdr sdr, ZcoReader *reader, unsigned int length, char *buffer)

Copies I<length> as-yet-uncopied bytes of source data from ZCO extents into
I<buffer>.  If I<buffer> is NULL, skips over I<length> bytes without
copying.  Returns number of bytes copied (or skipped) on success, 0 on any
file access error, -1 on any other error.

=item int zco_receive_trailers(Sdr sdr, ZcoReader *reader, unsigned int length, char *buffer)

Copies I<length> as-yet-uncopied bytes of trailer data from ZCO extents into
I<buffer>.  If I<buffer> is NULL, skips over I<length> bytes without copying.
Returns number of bytes copied (or skipped) on success, 0 on any file access
error, -1 on any other error.

=item void zco_stop_receiving(Sdr sdr, ZcoReader *reader)

Terminates extraction of this inbound ZCO's bytes for reception.

=item void zco_strip(Sdr sdr, Object zcoRef)

Deletes all source data extents that contain only header or trailer data and
adjusts the offsets and/or lengths of all remaining extents to exclude any
known header or trailer data.  Use this function before concatenating with
another ZCO, before starting the transmission of a ZCO that was received
from an underlying protocol layer rather than from an overlying application
or protocol layer, and before enqueuing the ZCO for reception by an
overlying application or protocol layer.
