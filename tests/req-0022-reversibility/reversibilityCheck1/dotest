# This test verifies that transaction reversibility is functional by triggering
# a condition where transaction reversibility is needed to correctly recover.
# Specifically, we tell ION that we're going to send bundles to a second node and
# define a tcpclo, but don't actually have a second node. We use a non-block application 
# (bpdriver) to forcefully inject too much data into ION causing SDR space exhaustion. 
# Eventually, ION will attempt to queue a bundle for which it doesn't have enough space,
# which will trigger a transaction cancellation and reversal.
#
# Transaction reversibility is required to handle this situation. Without it, ION
# will crash because it can't undo the current transaction. After the transaction
# reseveral, the ionrestart utility reloaded the volatile state of ION and BP protocols,
# and the daemons were restarted. We let all the previously buffered bundles expire to 
# clear the system, and then confirm that ION is able to continue taking bundles to queue
# for transmission.
#
# This test is extremely sensitive to changes in congestion forecasting. Ideally,
# we'd like to turn off congestion forecasting completely in order to prevent it
# from interfering.
