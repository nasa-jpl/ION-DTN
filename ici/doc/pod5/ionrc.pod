=head1 NAME

ionrc - ION node management commands file

=head1 DESCRIPTION

ION node management commands are passed to B<ionadmin> either in a file of
text lines or interactively at B<ionadmin>'s command prompt (:).  Commands
are interpreted line-by line, with exactly one command per line.  The formats
and effects of the ION node management commands are described below.

=head1 TIME REPRESENTATION

For many ION node management commands, time values must be passed as
arguments.  Every time value may be represented in either of two formats.
Absolute time is expressed as: 

=over 4

I<yyyy>/I<mm>/I<dd>-I<hh>:I<mm>:I<ss>

=back

Relative time (a number of seconds following the current I<reference time>,
which defaults to the current time at the moment I<ionadmin> began execution
but which can be overridden by the B<at> command described below) is expressed
as:

=over 4

+I<ss>

=head1 COMMANDS

=over 4

=item B<?>

The B<help> command.  This will display a listing of the commands and their
formats.  It is the same as the B<h> command.

=item B<#>

Comment line.  Lines beginning with B<#> are not interpreted.

=item B<e> { 1 | 0 }

Echo control.  Setting echo to 1 causes all output printed by ionadmin to
be logged as well as sent to stdout.  Setting echo to 0 disables this behavior.

=item B<v> 

Version number.  Prints out the version of ION currently installed.  HINT:
combine with B<e 1> command to log the version number at startup.

=item B<1> I<node_number> { I<ion_config_filename> | '' }

The B<initialize> command.  Until this command is executed, the local ION
node does not exist and most I<ionadmin> commands will fail.

The command configures the local node to be identified by I<node_number>, a
CBHE node number which uniquely identifies the node in the delay-tolerant
network.  It also configures ION's data store (SDR) and shared working-memory
region using either the settings found in the I<ion_config_filename> file
or, if '' is supplied as the I<ion_config_filename>, a set of default
settings.  Please see ionconfig(5) for details.

For example:

	1 19 ''

would initialize ION on the local computer, assigning the local ION node the
node number 19 and using default values to configure the data store and
shared working-memory region.

=item B<@> I<time>

The B<at> command.  This is used to set the reference time that will be
used for interpreting relative time values from now until the next revision
of reference time.  Note that the new reference time can be a relative time,
i.e., an offset beyond the current reference time.

=item B<a contact> I<start_time> I<stop_time> I<source_node> I<dest_node> I<xmit_data_rate>

The B<add contact> command.  This command schedules a period of data
transmission from I<source_node> to I<dest_node>.  The period of
transmission will begin at I<start_time> and end at I<stop_time>,
and the rate of data transmission will be I<xmit_data_rate> bytes/second.

=item B<d contact> I<start_time> I<source_node> I<dest_node>

The B<delete contact> command.  This command deletes the scheduled
period of data transmission from I<source_node> to I<dest_node> starting
at I<start_time>.  To delete all contacts between some pair of nodes,
use '*' as I<start_time>.

=item B<i contact> I<start_time> I<source_node> I<dest_node>

This command will print information (the stop time and data rate) about
the scheduled period of transmission from I<source_node> to I<dest_node>
that starts at I<start_time>.

=item B<l contact>

This command lists all scheduled periods of data transmission.

=item B<a range> I<start_time> I<stop_time> I<one_node> I<the_other_node> I<distance>

The B<add range> command.  This command predicts a period of time during
which the distance from I<one_node> to I<the_other_node> will be constant
to within one light second.  The period will begin at I<start_time> and
end at I<stop_time>, and the distance between the nodes during that time
will be I<distance> light seconds.

=item B<d range> I<start_time> I<one_node> I<the_other_node>

The B<delete range> command.  This command deletes the predicted period of
constant distance between I<one_node> and I<the_other_node> starting
at I<start_time>.  To delete all ranges between some pair of nodes,
use '*' as I<start_time>.

=item B<i range> I<start_time> I<one_node> I<the_other_node>

This command will print information (the stop time and range) about the
predicted period of constant distance between I<one_node> and I<the_other_node>
that starts at I<start_time>.

=item B<l range>

This command lists all predicted periods of constant distance.

=item B<m utcdelta> I<local_time_sec_after_UTC>

This management command sets ION's understanding of the current difference
between correct UTC time and the time values reported by the clock for the
local ION node's computer.  This delta is automatically applied to locally
obtained time values whenever ION needs to know the current time.  For
machines that use UTC natively and are synchronized by NTP, the value
of this delta should be 0, the default.

=item B<m clockerr> I<known_maximum_clock_error>

This management command sets ION's understanding of the accuracy of the
scheduled start and stop times of planned contacts, in seconds.  The
default value is 1.  When revising local data transmission and reception
rates, I<ionadmin> will adjust contact start and stop times by this
interval to be sure not to send bundles that arrive before the neighbor
expects data arrival or to discard bundles that arrive slightly before
they were expected.

=item B<m clocksync> [ { 1 | 0 } ]

This management command reports whether or not the computer on which
the local ION node is running has a synchronized clock, as discussed in
the description of the ionClockIsSynchronized() function (ion(3)).

If a Boolean argument is provided when the command is executed, the
characterization of the machine's clock is revised to conform with
the asserted value.  The default value is 1.

=item B<m production> I<planned_data_production_rate>

This management command sets ION's expectation of the mean rate of continuous
data origination by local BP applications throughout the period of time
over which congestion forecasts are computed.  For nodes that function only
as routers this variable will normally be zero.  A value of -1, which is the
default, indicates that the rate of local data production is unknown; in that
case local data production is not considered in the computation of congestion
forecasts.

=item B<m consumption> I<planned_data_consumption_rate>

This management command sets ION's expectation of the mean rate of continuous
data delivery to local BP applications throughout the period of time
over which congestion forecasts are computed.  For nodes that function only
as routers this variable will normally be zero.  A value of -1, which is the
default, indicates that the rate of local data consumption is unknown; in
that case local data consumption is not considered in the computation of
congestion forecasts.

=item B<m occupancy> I<heap_occupancy_limit> [I<file_system_occupancy_limit>]

This management command sets the maximum number of megabytes of storage space
in ION's SDR non-volatile heap, and/or in the local file system, that can be
used for the storage of zero-copy objects.  A value of -1 for either limit
signifies "leave unchanged".  The default heap limit is 60% of the SDR data
store's total heap size.  The default file system limit is 1 Terabyte.

=item B<m horizon> { 0 | I<end_time_for_congestion_forecasts> }

This management command sets the end time for computed congestion
forecasts.  Setting congestion forecast horizon to zero sets the congestion
forecast end time to infinite time in the future: if there is any predicted
net growth in bundle storage space occupancy at all, following the end of
the last scheduled contact, then eventual congestion will be predicted.  The
default value is zero, i.e., no end time.

=item B<m alarm> 'I<congestion_alarm_command>'

This management command establishes a command which will automatically be
executed whenever I<ionadmin> predicts that the node will become congested
at some future time.  By default, there is no alarm command.

=item B<m usage>

This management command simply prints ION's current data store occupancy
(the number of megabytes of space in the SDR non-volatile heap and file system
that are occupied by bundles), the limit on occupancy, and the maximum level
of occupancy predicted by the most recent I<ionadmin> congestion forecast
computation.

=item B<r> 'I<command_text>'

The B<run> command.  This command will execute I<command_text> as if it
had been typed at a console prompt.  It is used to, for example, run
another administrative program.

=item B<s>

The B<start> command.  This command starts the I<rfxclock> task on the local
ION node.

=item B<x>

The B<stop> command.  This command stops the I<rfxclock> task on the local
ION node.

=item B<h>

The B<help> command.  This will display a listing of the commands and their
formats.  It is the same as the B<?> command.
