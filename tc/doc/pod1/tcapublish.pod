=head1 NAME

tcapublish - Trusted Collective authority task that publishes consensus critical information bulletins

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<tcapublish> I<blocks_group_number>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<tcapublish> is a background task that completes the processing of a single
iteration of the bulletin publication cycle for the collective authority
function of the TC application identified by I<blocks_group_number> on the
local node.  To do so, it receives proposed bulletins multicast by
B<tcacompile> daemons, resolves differences among the received bulletins
to arrive at a consensus bulletin, computes a hash for the consensus bulletin,
erasure-codes the consensus bulletin, and multicasts that subset of the
resulting code blocks that is allocated to the local node according
to the local node's assigned position in the authority array of the
application's collective authority.  It is spawned automatically by the
local node's B<tcacompile> daemon for the indicated application, at the time
that daemon publishes its own proposed bulletin for this iteration of the
bulletin compilation cycle; it terminates immediately after it has finished
publishing code blocks.
