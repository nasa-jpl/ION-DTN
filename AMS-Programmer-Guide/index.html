<h2 id="purpose-and-scope">Purpose and Scope</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems\' (CCSDS)
Asynchronous Message Service (AMS) is a communication architecture for
data systems. It is designed to allow mission system modules to
operate as if they were isolated, each producing and consuming mission
information without explicit knowledge of the other active modules.
This self-configuring communication relationship minimizes complexity
in the development and operation of modular data systems.</p>
<p>AMS is the foundation of a system that can be described as a
\'society\' of largely autonomous, interoperating modules. These
modules can adapt over time in response to changing mission
objectives, functional upgrades of modules, and recovery from
individual module failures. The primary objective of AMS is to reduce
mission cost and risk by providing a standard, reusable infrastructure
for information exchange among data system modules. This
infrastructure is designed to be user-friendly, highly automated,
flexible, robust, scalable, and efficient.</p>
<p>Notably, AMS provides a publication and subscription service for both
terrestrial and extraterrestrial communications, utilizing the
Interplanetary Overlay Network (ION). This service ensures a seamless
and efficient communication system that can adapt dynamically to
various missions.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="definitions">Definitions</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Within the context of this document the following definitions apply:</p>
<p>A <em>continuum</em> is a closed set of entities that utilize AMS for
purposes of communication among themselves. Each continuum is
identified by a <em>continuum name</em> and corresponding non-negative
continuum number. The continuum name that is the character string of
length zero indicates "all known continua" or "any known continuum",
whichever is less restrictive in the context in which this continuum
name is used; the reserved continuum number zero corresponds to this
continuum name.</p>
<p>An <em>application</em> is a data system implementation, typically taking the
form of a set of source code text files, that relies on AMS procedures
to accomplish its purposes. Each application is identified by an
<em>application name</em>.</p>
<p>An <em>authority</em> is an administrative entity or persona that may have
responsibility for the configuration and operation of an application.
Each authority is identified by an <em>authority name</em>.</p>
<p>A <em>venture</em> is an instance of an application, i.e., a functioning
projection of the application -- for which some authority is
responsible -- onto a set of one or more running computers.</p>
<p>A <em>message</em> is an octet array of known size which, when copied from
the memory of one module of a venture to that of another
(<em>exchanged</em>), conveys information that can further the purposes of
that venture.</p>
<p>The <em>content</em> of a message is the array of zero or more octets
embedded in the message containing the specific information that the
message conveys.</p>
<p>A <em>role</em> is some part of the functionality of an application. Each
role is identified by a <em>role name</em> and corresponding non-negative
role number. The role name that is the character string of length zero
indicates 'all roles' or 'any role', whichever is less restrictive in
the context in which the role name is used; the reserved role number
zero corresponds to this role name. The role name "RAMS \'\'
identifies Remote AMS (RAMS) gateway functionality as discussed below;
the reserved role number 1 corresponds to this role name.</p>
<p>A <em>module</em> (of some mission data system) is a communicating entity
that implements some part of the functionality of some AMS venture --
that is, performs some application role -- by, among other activities,
exchanging messages with other modules. Associated with each module is
the name of the role it performs within the application. [Note that
multiple modules may perform the same role in an application, so the
role name of a module need not uniquely identify the module within its
message space.] In order to accomplish AMS message exchange a module
generates AMS service requests and consumes AMS service indications;
the module that is the origin of a given AMS service request or the
destination of a given AMS service indication is termed <em>the operative
module</em>.</p>
<p>A <em>message space</em> is the set of all of the modules of one AMS venture
that are members of a single AMS continuum; that is, a message space
is the intersection of a venture and a continuum. Each message space
is uniquely identified within that continuum by the combination of the
name of the application and the name of the authority that is
responsible for the venture, and by a corresponding venture number
greater than zero. [Note that unique naming of continua enables
multiple message spaces that are in different continua but are
identified by the same application and authority names to be
concatenated via Remote AMS (discussed below) into a single venture.]</p>
<p>A <em>unit</em> (i.e., a unit of organization) is an identified subset of the
organizational hierarchy of the modules of one AMS venture, declared
during venture configuration as specified by the responsible authority
for that venture. Each unit is uniquely identified within the venture
by <em>unit name</em> and corresponding non-negative unit number. The <em>root
unit</em> of a venture is the unit that is coterminous with the venture
itself; its unit name is the character string that is of length zero,
and the reserved unit number zero corresponds to this unit name. A
unit whose name is identical to the first N bytes -- where N is
greater than or equal to zero -- of the name of another unit of the
same message space is said to <em>contain</em> that other unit. The
membership of a unit that is contained by another unit is a subset of
the membership of the containing unit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A <em>cell</em> is the set of all modules that are members of one unit of a
given venture and are also members of a given continuum; that is, it is
the intersection of a unit and a continuum. Since each unit is a subset
of a venture, each cell is necessarily a subset of the message space for
that venture in that continuum. Each cell is uniquely identified within
its message space by its unit's name and number. The root cell of a
message space is coterminous with the message space itself. A cell
contains some other cell only if its unit contains that other cell's
unit. A cell may be an empty set; that is, in a given continuum there
may be no modules that are members of the cell's unit. The <em>registered
membership</em> of a cell is the set of all modules in the cell that are not
members of any other cell which does not contain that cell^1^. [Note
that the root cell contains every other cell in the message space, and
every module in the message space is therefore a member -- though not
necessarily a registered member -- of the root cell.]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <em>domain</em> of an AMS service request is the set of modules to which
the request pertains. It comprises all of the modules that are members
of the venture in which the operative module is itself a member, with
the following exceptions:</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>If the service request is one for which continuum ID is not
  specified, then only modules that are members of the local continuum
  are members of the service request's domain. Otherwise, if the
  service request's continuum ID parameter does not indicate "all
  continua", then only modules that are members of the continuum
  identified by the service request's continuum ID parameter are
  members of the service request's domain.</li>
<li>Only modules that are members of the organizational unit identified
  by the service request's unit ID parameter are members of the
  service request's domain.</li>
<li>If the service request's role ID parameter does not indicate "all
  roles", then only modules performing the role identified by that
  role ID are members of the service request's domain.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>The <em>subject number</em> (or <em>subject</em>) of a message is an integer
embedded in the message that indicates the general nature of the
information the message conveys, in the context of the AMS venture
within which the message is exchanged. A <em>subject name</em> is a text
string that serves as the symbolic representation of some subject
number.</p>
<p>To <em>send</em> a message is to cause it to be copied to the memory of a
specified module. To <em>publish</em> a message on a specified subject is to
cause it to be sent to one or more implicitly specified modules,
namely, all those that have requested copies of all messages on the
specified subject. To <em>announce</em> a message is to cause it to be sent
to one or more implicitly specified modules, namely, all those modules
that are located within a specified continuum (or all continua), are
members of a specified unit (possibly the root unit) and that perform
a specified role in the application (possibly "any role").</p>
<p>A <em>subscription</em> is a statement requesting that one copy of every
message published on some specified subject by any module in the
subscription's <em>domain</em> be sent to the subscribing module; the domain
of a subscription is the domain of the AMS service request that
established the subscription.</p>
<p>^1^ For example, if cell A contains cells B and C, and cell C contains
cells D and E, any nodes in C that are not in either D or E are in the
registered membership of cell C. Those nodes are also members of cell
A, but because they are in cell C -- which does not contain cell A --
they are not in cell A's registered membership.</p>
<p>An <em>invitation</em> is a statement of the manner in which messages on some
specified subject may be sent to the inviting module by modules in the
<em>domain</em> of the invitation; the invitation's domain is the domain of
the AMS service request that established the invitation.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Architectural Character</strong></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>A data system based on AMS has the following characteristics:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>a.  Any module may be introduced into the system at any time. That is,
    the order in which system modules commence operation is immaterial;
    a module never needs to establish an explicit <em>a priori</em>
    communication "connection" or "channel" to any other module in order
    to pass messages to it or receive messages from it.</p>
<p>b.  Any module may be removed from the system at any time without
    inhibiting the ability of any other module to continue sending and
    receiving messages. That is, the termination of any module, whether
    planned or unplanned, only causes the termination of other modules
    that have been specifically designed to terminate in this event.</p>
<p>c.  When a module must be upgraded to an improved version, it may be
    terminated and its replacement may be started at any time; there is
    no need to interrupt operations of the system as a whole.</p>
<p>d.  When the system as a whole must terminate, the order in which the
    system's modules cease operation is immaterial.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>AMS-based systems are highly robust, lacking any innate single point
of failure and tolerant of unplanned module termination. At the same
time, communication within an AMS-based system can be rapid and
efficient:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>e.  Messages are exchanged directly between modules rather than through
    any central message dispatching nexus.</p>
<p>f.  Messages are automatically conveyed using the "best" (typically --
    though not necessarily -- the fastest) underlying transport service
    to which the sending and receiving modules both have access. For
    example, messages between two ground system modules running in
    different computers on a common LAN would likely be conveyed via
    TCP/IP, while messages between modules running on two flight
    processors connected to a common bus memory board might be conveyed
    via a shared-memory message queue.</p>
<p>g.  Finally, AMS is designed to be highly scalable: partitioning message
    spaces into units enables a venture to comprise hundreds or
    thousands of cooperating modules without significant impact on
    application performance.</p>

</code></pre></div>
<ol>
<li><strong>Message Exchange Models</strong></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>AMS message exchange is fundamentally asynchronous, akin to a
\"postal\" system. An AMS module, after sending a message, can
continue its functions without waiting for a reply.</p>
<p>While message exchange is asynchronous, AMS provides a mechanism for
linking reply messages to their original context. This is achieved by
including a context number in the original message. The reply message
automatically echoes this context number, allowing the original sender
to link the reply to the application activity that triggered the
initial message. This creates a pseudo-synchronous communication flow.
The specific mechanism for establishing this link is
implementation-dependent.</p>
<p>In some cases, true message synchrony may be necessary, requiring a
module to suspend operations until a reply is received. AMS supports
this communication model when required.</p>
<p>The majority of message exchange in an AMS-based system follows a
\"publish-subscribe\" model. A module announces its subscription to a
specific subject using AMS procedures. From that point, any published
message on that subject is automatically delivered to all subscribing
modules. This model simplifies application development and
integration, allowing each module to plug into a data \"grid\" and
exchange data without detailed knowledge of other modules.</p>
<p>However, there may be instances where a module needs to send a message
privately to a specific module, such as in reply to a published
message. AMS also supports this communication model when necessary.</p>

<p>All AMS communication is conducted among three types of communicating
entities: modules (defined earlier), registrars, and configuration
servers.</p>
<p>A <em>registrar</em> is a communicating entity that catalogs information
regarding the registered membership of a single unit of a message
space. It responds to queries for this information, and it updates
this information as changes are announced.</p>
<p>A <em>configuration server</em> is a communicating entity that catalogs
information regarding the message spaces established within some AMS
continuum, specifically the locations of the registrars of all units
of all message spaces. It responds to queries for this information,
and it updates this information as changes are announced.</p>

<h3 id="overview-of-interactions">Overview of Interactions</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Transport Services for Application Messages</strong></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>AMS, best characterized as a messaging \"middleware\" protocol,
operates between the Transport and Application layers of the OSI
protocol stack model. It relies on underlying Transport-layer
protocols for actual message copying from sender to receiver and for
transmitting meta-AMS (or MAMS) messages for dynamic
self-configuration of AMS message spaces.</p>
<p>In any AMS continuum, a common transport service, termed the Primary
Transport Service (PTS), is used for MAMS traffic by all entities
involved in the operations of all message spaces. The PTS, being
universally available, can also be used for application message
exchange among all modules in a continuum. However, in some cases,
performance can be improved by using Supplementary Transport Services
(STSs), especially when modules share access to a convenient
communication medium like a shared-memory message queue.</p>
<p>Supplementary Transport Services (STSs) are performance-optimizing
transport services used in the Asynchronous Message Service (AMS) for
message exchange between modules that share access to a particularly
convenient communication medium, such as a shared-memory message
queue. While the Primary Transport Service (PTS) is universally
available for message exchange, STSs can be employed to enhance
application performance in certain scenarios (see CCSDS Blue Book
Recommended Standard 735.1-B-1 \"Asynchronous Message Service\" for
additional information).</p>
<p>A module\'s network location for receiving messages via a given
transport service is its delivery point for that service. A module may
have multiple delivery points, each characterized by the same service
mode. For a given service mode, the list of all delivery points
providing that mode to a module, ranked in descending order of
preference (typically network performance), is termed the delivery
vector for that service mode, for that module.</p>
<p>See "Primary Transport Services" below for additional information.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li><strong>Registrar Registration</strong></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Every message space in AMS always includes at least one unit, the root
unit, and each module is registered within a unit. In the simplest
case, all modules reside in the root unit. Each unit is served by a
single registrar, which monitors the health of all registered modules
and propagates six types of message space configuration changes.</p>
<p>Registrars themselves register with the configuration server for the
continuum containing the message space. A list of all potential
network locations for the configuration server, ranked in descending
order of preference, must be well-known and included in the AMS
management information bases (MIBs) accessible to all registrars. Each
continuum must always have an operational configuration server at one
of these locations to enable registration of registrars and modules.</p>
<p>All registrars and modules of the same message space must register
through the same configuration server.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li><strong>Module Registration</strong></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Each module has a single meta-AMS delivery point (MAPD) for receiving
MAMS messages. A new module joins a message space by registering
within a unit, announcing its role name and MAPD to the unit\'s
registrar. However, the module cannot have hard-coded information
about the registrar\'s communication details, as these can change.</p>
<p>Therefore, the first step in registering a new module is contacting
the configuration server at one of its known network locations. These
locations, listed in descending order of preference, are included in
the AMS Management Information Bases (MIBs) accessible to all
application modules. The configuration server then provides the new
module with the contact details for its registrar.</p>
<p>The module obtains a unique module number from the registrar and
completes registration. The registrar ensures that all other modules
in the message space learn the new module\'s role name, module number,
and MAPD. These modules, in turn, announce their own details to the
new module.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li><strong>Monitoring Module Health</strong></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Maintaining accurate knowledge of a message space configuration is
crucial for application purposes and resource efficiency. Each
registrar must promptly detect the termination of modules in its
unit\'s registered membership. While a module under application
control notifies its registrar upon termination, a module that crashes
or is powered off does not. To address this, each module sends a
\"heartbeat\" message to its registrar every few seconds (see comment</p>
<h1 id="3-at-top-of-amscommonh-for-additional-details-the-registrar">3 at top of amscommon.h for additional details). The registrar</h1>
<p>interprets three consecutive missing heartbeats as a module
termination.</p>
<p>Upon detecting a module\'s termination, either overt or imputed from
heartbeat failure, the registrar informs all other modules in the
unit\'s registered membership and, through other registrars, all
modules in the message space.</p>
<p>When termination is imputed from a heartbeat failure, the registrar
attempts to notify the presumed terminated module. If the module is
still running, it terminates immediately upon receiving this message,
minimizing system confusion due to other application behavior
triggered by the imputed termination.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li><strong>Monitoring Registrar Health</strong></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Each registrar not only monitors the heartbeats of all modules in its
unit\'s registered membership but also issues its own heartbeats to
those modules. If a module detects three consecutive missing registrar
heartbeats, it assumes the registrar has crashed. The module then
re-queries the configuration server to determine the new network
location of the registrar and resumes exchanging heartbeats.</p>
<p>This assumption is reasonable because the configuration server also
monitors registrar heartbeats on a slightly shorter cycle. If the
configuration server detects three consecutive missing registrar
heartbeats, it takes action to restart the registrar, possibly on a
different host. Therefore, by the time the registrar\'s modules detect
its crash, it should already be running again.</p>
<p>Since the module heartbeat interval is two seconds (see N4 in
amscommon.h), the registrar will receive heartbeat messages from every
running module in the unit\'s registered membership within the first
six seconds after restart. This allows the registrar to accurately
know the unit\'s configuration. This accurate configuration
information must be delivered to new modules at startup, enabling them
to orient a newly-restarted registrar if it crashes. Therefore, during
the first six seconds after the registrar starts, it only accepts MAMS
messages from modules already registered in the unit. This prevents
the risk of delivering incorrect information to a new module.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li><strong>Configuration Service Fail-over</strong></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>A configuration server, like any other component, can also fail or be
rebooted. Each registrar interprets three consecutive missing
configuration server heartbeats as an indication of a crash. Upon
detecting such a crash, the registrar cycles through all the known
network locations for the continuum's configuration server, attempting
to re-establish communication after the server's restart, possibly at
an alternate network location. New modules attempting to register will
also cycle through network locations seeking a restarted configuration
server and will be unable to contact their registrars, and therefore
unable to register, until they find one. However, application message
exchange and subscription management activity among existing modules
and registrars are not affected by this infrastructure failure.</p>
<p>Upon the configuration server\'s restart at one of its known network
locations, all registrars will eventually find it and re-announce
themselves, enabling newly registering application modules to
successfully register.</p>
<p>In certain failure scenarios, multiple configuration servers may
operate concurrently for a brief period, such as when a perceived
failure is caused by a transient network connectivity issue rather
than an actual server crash. To resolve this, each running
configuration server periodically sends an "I am running" MAMS message
to every lower-ranking configuration server network location in the
known list of configuration server locations. If a configuration
server receives such a message, it immediately terminates. All
registrars and modules communicating with it will detect its
disappearance and search again for the highest-ranking reachable
configuration server, eventually restoring orderly operations in the
continuum.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li><strong>Configuration Resync</strong></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Finally, every registrar can optionally be configured to re-advertise
to the entire message space the detailed configuration of its unit's
registered membership (all active modules, all subscriptions and
invitations) at some user-specified frequency, e.g., once per minute.
This capability is referred to as <em>configuration resync</em>.
Configuration resync of course generates additional message traffic,
and it may be unnecessary in extremely simple or extremely stable
operating environments. But it does ensure that every change in
application message space configuration will eventually be propagated
to every module in the message space, even if some MAMS messages are
lost and even if an arbitrary number of registrars had crashed at the
time the change occurred.</p>
<p>Taken together, these measures make AMS applications relatively fault
tolerant:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>a.  When a module crashes, its registrar detects the loss of heartbeat
    within three heartbeat intervals and notifies the rest of the
    message space. Application message transmission everywhere is
    unaffected.When a registrar crashes, its configuration server
    detects the loss of heartbeat within three heartbeat intervals and
    takes action to restart the registrar. During the time that the unit
    has no registrar, transmission of application messages among modules
    of the message space is unaffected, but the heartbeat failures of
    crashed modules are not detected and reconfiguration messages
    originating in the unit's registered membership (registrations,
    terminations, subscription and invitation assertions, and
    subscription and invitation cancellations) are not propagated to any
    modules. However, after the registrar is restarted it will
    eventually detect the losses of heartbeat from all crashed modules
    and will issue obituaries to the message space, and if configuration
    resync is enabled it will eventually re- propagate the lost
    reconfiguration messages.</p>
<p>b.  When a configuration server crashes, all new registration activity
    will come to a standstill. But no application modules fail (at
    least, not because of communication failure), and on restart of the
    configuration server the registration of new modules eventually
    resumes.</p>

<li><strong>Security</strong></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>AMS can be configured to confine service access to application modules
that can prove they are authorized to participate. For this purpose,
asymmetric MAMS encryption may be used as follows:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>a.  The AMS MIB exposed to the configuration server contains a list of
    all applications for which registration service may be offered,
    identified by application name. Associated with each application
    name is the AMS public encryption key for that application.</p>
<p>b.  The AMS MIB exposed to every registrar in each message space
    contains a list of all functional role names defined for the message
    space's application; this list limits the role names under which
    modules may register in that message space. Associated with each
    role name is the AMS public encryption key for the application
    module(s) that may register in that role.</p>
<p>c.  The AMS MIBs exposed to all registrars and application modules in
    the message space contain the AMS public encryption key of the
    configuration server.</p>
<p>d.  The AMS MIBs exposed to the configuration server and to all
    registrars and application modules in the message space contain the
    private encryption keys that are relevant to those entities.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As described later, this information is used to authenticate registrar
registration and exclude spurious registrars from the message space,
to authenticate module registration attempts and deny registration to
unauthorized application modules, and to assure the authenticity,
confidentiality, and integrity of MAMS traffic exchanged between
modules and their registrars.</p>
<p>In addition, the confidentiality and integrity of AMS message exchange
may be protected at subject granularity. The AMS MIB exposed to each
module of a given message space may contain, for any subset of the
message subjects (identified by name and number) used in the message
space's application:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>e.  a list of the role names of all modules that are authorized senders
    of messages on this subject;</p>
<p>f.  a list of the role names of all modules that are authorized
    receivers of messages on this subject;</p>
<p>g.  encryption parameters, including a symmetric encryption key,
    enabling encryption of messages on this subject.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This information may be used to support secure transmission of
messages on selected subjects.</p>
<p><strong><em>Note</em>*, though, that the JPL implementation of AMS </strong>does not
implement*<em> any of the cryptographic algorithms that are required to
support these security features.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li><strong>Subject Catalog</strong></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>The structure of the content of messages on a given subject is
application-specific; message content structure is not defined by the
AMS protocol. However, the AMS MIB exposed to all modules of a given
message space will contain, for each message subject (identified by
name and number) used in the message space:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>a.  a description of this message subject, discussing the semantics of
    this type of message;</p>
<p>b.  a detailed specification of the structure of the content of messages
    on this subject;</p>
<p>c.  optionally, a specification of the manner in which a correctly
    assembled message is marshaled for network transmission in a
    platform-neutral manner and, on reception, un-marshaled into a
    format that is suitable for processing by the application.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When AMS is requested to send a message on a given subject, the
message content that is presented for transmission is always in a
format that is suitable for processing by the application. In the
event that this format is not suitable for network transmission in a
platform-neutral manner, as indicated by the presence in the MIB of a
marshaling specification for this subject, AMS will marshal the
message content as required before transmitting the message.</p>
<p>When AMS receives a message on a subject for which a marshaling
specification is present in the MIB, AMS will un-marshal the message
content into a format that is suitable for processing by the
application before delivering the message.</p>
<p>Message subjects, as noted earlier, are integers with
application-defined semantics. This minimizes the cost of including
subject information (in effect, message type) in every message, and it
makes processing simpler and faster: subscription and invitation
information are recorded in arrays that are indexed by subject number.</p>
<p>This implementation choice, however, requires that message management
control arrays be large enough to accommodate the largest subject
numbers used in the application. The use of extremely large subject
numbers would therefore cause these arrays to consume significant
amounts of memory. In general, it is best for an AMS application to
use the <strong>smallest</strong> subject numbers possible, starting with 1.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li><strong>Remote AMS Message Exchange</strong></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>AMS' asynchronous message issuance model allows for a high degree of
concurrency in the operations of data system modules. This means that
a module can issue a message without suspending its operation until a
response is received. This feature also largely insulates applications
from variations in signal propagation time across the AMS continuum.</p>
<p>However, some critical MAMS (Multicast AMS) communication is
unavoidably synchronous. For instance, a newly registering module must
wait for responses from the configuration server and the registrar
before it can proceed with application activity. Therefore, the core
AMS protocol is best suited for operational contexts with generally
uninterrupted network connectivity and relatively small and
predictable signal propagation times, such as the Internet or a
stand-alone local area network. It is typically advantageous for all
entities within a single AMS continuum to operate within such a
\"low-latency\" environment</p>
<p>AMS application messages can be exchanged between modules in different
AMS continua using the Remote AMS (RAMS) procedures. These procedures
are executed by special-purpose application modules known as RAMS
gateways. Each RAMS gateway interfaces with two communication
environments: the AMS message space it serves and the RAMS network,
which is a mesh or tree of mutually aware RAMS gateways. This network
enables AMS messages produced in one message space to be forwarded to
other message spaces within the same venture.. RAMS gateways operate
as follows:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>a.  RAMS gateways operate by opening private RAMS network communication
    channels to the RAMS gateways of other message spaces within the
    same venture. These interconnected gateways use these communication
    channels to forward message petition assertions and cancellations
    among themselves.</p>
<p>b.  Each RAMS gateway subscribes locally to all subjects that are of
    interest in any of the linked message spaces.</p>
<p>c.  When a RAMS gateway receives a message on any of these subjects, it
    uses the RAMS network to forward the message to every other linked
    RAMS gateway whose message space contains at least one module that
    has subscribed to messages on that subject.</p>
<p>d.  On receiving a message the RAMS gateway module forwards the message
    to any subscribers in its own message space.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The RAMS protocol allows for the free flow of published application
messages across deep space links while ensuring efficient utilization
of those links. Only a single copy of any message is ever transmitted
on any RAMS grid communication channel, regardless of how many
subscribers will receive copies when the message reaches its
destination.</p>
<p>RAMS operations generalize the AMS architecture as shown in Figure 2
below.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img alt="" src="../media-ams-program/media/image3.png" />{width="6.23578302712161e-3in"
height="1.9860017497812773e-3in"}</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Figure 2 General AMS application structure</strong></p>
<p>This extension of the publish/subscribe model to inter-continuum
communications is invisible to application modules. Application
functionality is unaffected by these details of network configuration,
and the only effects on behavior being those intrinsic to variability
in message propagation latency.</p>
<p>It\'s important to note that the nature of the RAMS network
communication channels depends on the implementation of the RAMS
network. To communicate over the RAMS network for a given venture,
each RAMS gateway must know the RAMS network location, expressed as an
endpoint in the protocol used to implement the RAMS network.</p>
<p>Also, only AMS application messages are propagated across continuum
boundaries by RAMS. Modules are never notified of registrations,
subscriptions, and invitations that occur in remote continua. The
purpose of RAMS is to limit traffic on the scarce link resources
supporting inter-continuum communication to the minimum necessary for
successful operation of the venture. MAMS message traffic within a
message space is required to enable the operation of the message
space, but venture-wide application message exchange can readily be
provided without propagating MAMS messages to remote continua.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="the-jpl-implementation">The JPL Implementation</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>JPL's implementation of AMS has the following components:</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>a daemon process (<strong>amsd</strong>) which can function as a configuration
  server, a registrar for a single message space, or both, depending
  on command-line parameters used when starting the process.</li>
<li>A library (<strong>libams</strong>) that implements the AMS application
  programming interface. This library is typically provided as a
  "shared object" that is dynamically linked with application code at
  run time.</li>
<li>An implementation of Remote AMS (RAMS) comprising a library
  (<strong>librams</strong>).</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>The codebase, written in C, relies on a shared library, ICI. This
library supports other JPL implementations, like CFDP and the DTN
Bundle Protocol. ICI includes a \"platform\" portability layer, easing
code compilation and execution in environments like Linux, vxWorks,
and Interix.</p>
<p>ICI also includes its own dynamic memory management system, called
"PSM", which provides dynamic management of a privately allocated
block of memory. This may be useful in environments such as spacecraft
flight software where the dynamic management of system memory
(<em>malloc</em>, <em>free</em>) cannot be tolerated. Use of PSM by AMS is optional.</p>
<p>An AMS application program, linked with <strong>libams</strong>, uses the
<em>ams_register</em> function to instantiate an AMS module registered within
a specified unit of a specified message space. Once registration is
accomplished, the application may commence inviting, subscribing to,
publishing, announcing, sending, and replying to messages.</p>
<p>This AMS implementation is multi-threaded. The process of registration
starts a pair of POSIX threads, or pthreads, which manage timing and
MAMS events in the background. Additionally, another pthread is
started to receive MAMS messages via the primary transport service and
add them to the MAMS event queue. This queue also includes MAMS
message transmission requests. For each transport service that the
module can receive AMS messages from, one more pthread is started.
These threads receive AMS messages and add them to the AMS event
queue, combining them with \"discovery\" events added by the MAMS
event handling thread.</p>
<p>The general structure of an AMS module, then, is as shown in <a href="#_heading=h.2s8eyo1">Figure
3</a> below.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[]{#_heading=h.2s8eyo1 .anchor}<strong>Figure 3 AMS module structure</strong></p>
<p>The application program has the option to start another thread to
manage AMS events. This thread automatically calls event-type-specific
callback functions, leaving the main application thread free to
respond to non-AMS events, such as mouse events or keyboard input. The
application code can also add application-specific events to the AMS
event queue, potentially with higher priority than any queued AMS
messages. However, to prevent certain types of unusual application
behavior, the main application thread is not allowed to receive and
handle any AMS events while the background AMS event handling thread
is running.</p>

<h1 id="primary-transport-services">Primary Transport Services</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>As shipped, AMS currently includes support for two underlying
transport services: TCP, and DGR (Datagram Retransmission, a UDP-based
system that includes congestion control and retransmission-based
reliability). Although TCP is faster than DGR, its connection-based
architecture makes it unsuitable as a primary transport service: all
MAMS message traffic is conveyed via connectionless DGR.</p>

<h2 id="automake">Automake</h2>
<p>This method automatically compiles and links all required executables,
installs them, and copies ION library headers to the relevant system
path(s) on your system.Use the following command sequence in the unzipped ION source directory
(Linux).</p>
<ol>
<li>./configure</li>
<li>make</li>
<li>sudo make install</li>
<li>sudo ldconfig</li>
</ol>
<p>Note: if support for the expat XML parsing library is required see 4.3
"Support for the Expat XML Parsing Library" below</p>
<h2 id="make">Make</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>This alternate installation method installs all ION packages (if run
from ION root directory), or installs individual ION packages as
follows</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Before installation, first determine which environment (i.e.
   platform) you're going to be building for: i86- redhat,
   i86_64-fedora, sparc-solaris, RTEMS, etc. Note this for the
   following step</li>
<li>Move the ION .gz file to a directory in which you want to build the
   system, gunzip the file, and then un-tar it; a number of new
   directories will appear.AMS requires the following packages: ici, dgr, ltp, bp, and ams. For
   each, in that <em>specific order</em>, do the following:cd to directory_namemodify Makefile (as needed):\"PLATFORMS = environment_name\"]modify Makefile (as needed):\"OPT = desired system path\"]makesudo make installcd ..</li>
<li>For additional information see the ION Design and Operations manual
   for dependency details and package build order instructions (see

</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that for both install methods (e.g. on Linux) the default
configuration used in the ION makefiles is as follows:</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>ION package binaries are installed into /usr/local/bin/</li>
<li>ION library objects are installed into /usr/local/lib/.</li>

<h1 id="the-ams-daemon">The AMS Daemon</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>The AMS daemon program <strong>amsd</strong> can function as the configuration
server for a continuum, as the registrar for one cell of a specified
message space, or both. To run it, enter a command of the following
form at a terminal window prompt:</p>
<p>amsd <em>mib_source_name eid_spec</em></p>
<p>or</p>
<p>amsd <em>mib_source_name eid_spec application_name authority_name
unit_name</em></p>
<p>The former form of the command starts <strong>amsd</strong> as a configuration
server only.</p>
<p><em>mib_source_name</em> is as discussed in the documentation of ams_register
below; it enables <strong>amsd</strong> to run.</p>
<p><em>eid_spec</em> is a string that specifies the IP address and port that
<strong>amsd</strong> must establish in order to receive MAMS messages in its
capacity as a configuration server. See <em>man amsd</em> for more
information.</p>
<p>When the latter form of the <strong>amsd</strong> command is used, the daemon is
configured to function as the registrar for the indicated message
space unit. If the value "." (period character) is supplied for
<em>eid_spec</em>, then the daemon will [only]{.underline} function as a
registrar. Otherwise the daemon will function as both configuration
server and registrar; this option can be useful when operating a
simple, stand-alone message space, such as a demo.</p>

<p>int [ams_register]{.underline}(char *mibSource, char *tsorder, char
*applicationName, char *authorityName, char *unitName, char
*roleName, AmsModule</p>
<p>*module);</p>
<p>This function is used to initiate the application's participation as a
module in the message space identified by specified application and
authority names, within the local AMS continuum.</p>
<p><em>mibSource</em> indicates the location of the Management Information Base
(MIB) information that will enable the proposed new module to
participate in its chosen message space. Nominally it is the name of
an XML file in the current working directory; if NULL, <em>mibSource</em>
defaults to <em>roleName</em>.xml. (A future version of loadmib.c might load
MIB information from an ICI "sdr" database rather than from a file.)</p>
<p><em>tsorder</em> is the applicable overriding transport service selection
order string. This capability is not yet fully supported; for now,
<em>tsorder</em> should always be NULL.</p>
<p><em>applicationName</em> identifies the AMS application within which the
proposed new module is designed to function. The application must be
declared in the MIB.</p>
<p><em>authorityName</em>, together with <em>applicationName</em>, identifies the
message space in which the new module proposes to register. The
message space must be declared in the MIB.</p>
<p><em>unitName</em> identifies the cell, within the specified message space, in
which the new module proposes to register. The unit must be declared
in the MIB for ventures containing the specified message space, and a
registrar for this cell of this message space must currently be
running in order for the ams_register function to succeed.</p>
<p><em>roleName</em> identifies the functional role that the proposed new module
is designed to perform within the indicated application. The role must
be declared in the MIB for that application, and its name will serve
as the name of the module.</p>
<p><em>module</em> points to the variable in which the applicable AMS service
access point will be returned upon successful registration of the new
module.</p>
<p>The function returns 0 on success, -1 on any error.</p>
<p>The application thread that invoked ams_register is assumed by AMS to
be the main application thread for the module, or "prime thread".
Following successful completion of ams_register all threads of the
application process may commence invoking AMS services -- inviting
messages, publishing messages, etc. -- except that only the prime
thread may receive AMS events, e.g., process incoming messages.</p>
<p>int [ams_get_module_nbr]{.underline}(AmsModule module);</p>
<p>The function returns the unique identifying number (within its chosen
cell) assigned to the indicated module as a result of successful
registration.</p>
<p>int [ams_get_unit_nbr]{.underline}(AmsModule module);</p>
<p>The function returns the number that uniquely (within the message
space) identifies the cell in which the module registered. The
combination of unit number and module number uniquely identifies the
module within its message space.</p>
<p>int [ams_set_event_mgr]{.underline}(AmsModule module, AmsEventMgt
*rules);</p>
<p>The function starts a background "event manager" thread that
automatically receives and processes all AMS events (messages, notices
of message space configuration change, etc.) enqueued for the
indicated module.</p>
<p>The thread processes each event according to the indicated <em>rules</em>
structure; any event for which a NULL callback function is provided is
simply discarded. For details of the rules structure and prototype
definitions for the callback functions that the rules point to, see
<a href="#type-and-macro-definitions">6.1</a> above. Some notes on this
interface:</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>None of the callback functions return values, so they cannot
  directly terminate the event manager. A callback function can
  indirectly terminate the event manager by signaling the prime thread
  to call ams_remove_event_mgr.</li>
<li>The event delivered to a callback is recycled automatically when the
  callback returns. If for some reason the application needs to retain
  the event for a while, the callback function can prevent
  therecycling of the event by simply setting <em>*eventRef</em> to NULL; in
  this case the application assumes responsibility for recycling the
  event at some future time in order to avert memory leakage.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>While the event manager thread is running, the prime thread is
prohibited from receiving any AMS events itself, i.e., ams_get_event
will always fail.</p>
<p>Only the prime thread may call ams_set_event_mgr. The function returns
0 on success, -1 on any error.</p>
<p>void [ams_remove_event_mgr]{.underline}(AmsModule module);</p>
<p>The function stops the background event manager thread for this
module, if any is running. Only the prime thread may call
ams_remove_event_mgr. Following completion of this function the prime
thread is once again able to receive and process AMS events.</p>
<p>int [ams_unregister]{.underline}(AmsModule module);</p>
<p>The function terminates the module's registration, ending the ability
of any thread of the application process to invoke any AMS services;
it automatically stops the background event manager thread for this
module, if any is running.</p>
<p>Only the prime thread may call ams_unregister. The function returns 0
on success, -1 on any error.</p>

<h2 id="message-subscription-and-invitation">Message Subscription and Invitation</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>int [ams_invite]{.underline}(AmsModule module, int roleNbr, int
continuumNbr, int unitNbr, int subjectNbr, int priority, unsigned char
flowLabel, AmsSequence sequence, AmsDiligence diligence);</p>
<p>This function establishes the module's willingness to accept messages
on a specified subject, under specified conditions, and states the
quality of service at which the module would prefer those messages to
be sent. Invitations are implicitly constrained by venture number:
only messages from modules registered in messages spaces characterized
by the same application and authority names as the message space in
which the inviting module itself is registered are included in any
invitation.</p>
<p><em>module</em> must be a valid AMS service access point as returned from
ams_register.</p>
<p><em>roleNbr</em> identifies the role that constrains the invitation: only
messages from modules registered as performing the indicated role are
included in this invitation. If zero, indicates "all modules".</p>
<p><em>continuumNbr</em> identifies the continuum that constrains the
invitation: only messages from modules operating within the indicated
continuum are included in this invitation. If -1, indicates "the local
continuum". If zero, indicates "all continua".</p>
<p><em>unitNbr</em> identifies the unit that constrains the invitation: only
messages from modules registered in cells identified by the indicated
number -- or in cells that are contained within such cells -- are
included in this invitation. A reminder: cell zero is the "root cell",
encompassing the entire message space.</p>
<p><em>subjectNbr</em> identifies the subject that constrains the invitation:
only messages on the indicated subject are included in this
invitation.</p>
<p><em>priority</em> indicates the level of priority (from 1 to 15, where 1 is
the highest priority indicating greatest urgency) at which the
inviting module prefers that messages responding to this invitation be
sent.</p>
<p><em>flowLabel</em> specifies the flow label (a number from 1 to 255, which
AMS may pass through to transport service adapters for
quality-of-service specification purposes) that the inviting module
asks issuing modules to cite when sending messages in response to this
invitation. Flow label 0 signifies "no flow label."</p>
<p><em>sequence</em> indicates the minimum level of transmission order
preservation that the inviting module requires for messages responding
to this invitation.</p>
<p><em>diligence</em> indicates the minimum level of reliability (based on
acknowledgement and retransmission) that the inviting module requires
for messages responding to this invitation.</p>
<p>The function returns 0 on success, -1 on any error. When successful,
it causes the invitation to be propagated automatically to all modules
in the inviting module's own message space.</p>
<p>int [ams_disinvite]{.underline}(AmsModule module, int roleNbr, int
continuumNbr, int unitNbr, int subjectNbr);</p>
<p>This function terminates the module's prior invitation for messages on
a specified subject under specified conditions. <em>roleNbr</em>,
<em>continuumNbr</em>, <em>unitNbr</em>, and <em>subjectNbr</em> must be identical to those
that characterized the invitation that is to be terminated. The
function returns 0 on success, -1 on any error. When successful, it
causes cancellation of the invitation to be propagated automatically
to all modules in the inviting module's own message space.</p>
<p>int [ams_subscribe]{.underline}(AmsModule module, int roleNbr, int
continuumNbr, int unitNbr, int subjectNbr, int priority, unsigned char
flowLabel, AmsSequence sequence, AmsDiligence diligence);</p>
<p>This function establishes the module's request to receive a copy of
every future message published on a specified subject, under specified
conditions, and states the quality of service at which the module
would prefer those messages to be sent. Subscriptions are implicitly
constrained by venture number: only messages from modules registered
in messages spaces characterized by the same application and authority
names as the message space in which the subscribing module itself is
registered are included in any subscription.</p>
<p><em>module</em> must be a valid AMS service access point as returned from
ams_register.</p>
<p><em>roleNbr</em> identifies the role that constrains the subscription: only
messages from modules registered as performing the indicated role are
included in this subscription. If zero, indicates "all modules".</p>
<p><em>continuumNbr</em> identifies the continuum that constrains the
subscription: only messages from modules operating within the
indicated continuum are included in this subscription. If -1,
indicates "the local continuum". If zero, indicates "all continua".</p>
<p><em>unitNbr</em> identifies the unit that constrains the subscription: only
messages from modules registered in cells identified by the indicated
number -- or in cells that are contained within such cells -- are
included in this subscription. A reminder: cell zero is the "root
cell", encompassing the entire message space.</p>
<p><em>subjectNbr</em> identifies the subject that constrains the subscription:
only messages on the indicated subject are included in this
subscription. <em>subjectNbr</em> may be zero to indicate that messages
published on all subjects are requested; in this case, <em>continuumNbr</em>
must be -1.</p>
<p><em>priority</em> indicates the level of priority (from 1 to 15, where 1 is
the highest priority indicating greatest urgency) at which the
subscribing module prefers that messages responding to this
subscription be sent.</p>
<p><em>flowLabel</em> specifies the flow label (a number from 1 to 255, which
AMS may pass through to transport service adapters for
quality-of-service specification purposes) that the subscribing module
asks issuing modules to cite when publishing messages in response to
this subscription. Flow label 0 signifies "no flow label."</p>
<p><em>sequence</em> indicates the minimum level of transmission order
preservation that the subscribing module requires for messages
responding to this subscription.</p>
<p><em>diligence</em> indicates the minimum level of reliability (based on
acknowledgement and retransmission) that the subscribing module
requires for messages responding to this subscription.</p>

it causes the subscription to be propagated automatically to all
modules in the subscribing module's own message space.</p>
<p>int [ams_unsubscribe]{.underline}(AmsModule module, int roleNbr, int

<blockquote>
<p>int [ams_post_user_event]{.underline}(AmsModule module, int

priority);</p>
<p>This function posts a user-defined event into the queue of AMS events
that have yet to be handled by the application. <em>userEventCode</em> is an
arbitrary, user-defined numeric value; <em>userEventData</em>, if not NULL,
is assumed to be an arbitrary, user-defined character string of length
<em>userEventDataLength</em>.</p>
<p><em>priority</em> may be any value from 0 to 16. Note that this enables the
application to post an event to itself that is guaranteed to be of
higher priority than any message -- assuring that it will be processed
before any message that is currently enqueued or that arrives in the
future -- or, alternatively, to post an event that is guaranteed to be
of lower priority than any message and will therefore only be
processed during a lull in message reception.</p>
<p>Returns 0 on success, -1 on any error.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="remote-ams">Remote AMS</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>The JPL implementation of Remote AMS comprises a library
(<strong>librams.c</strong>) and a sample RAMS gateway program (<strong>ramsTest.c</strong>)
that uses that library.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="library">Library</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The RAMS library implements a very simple API, which is defined by the
header file</p>
<p><strong>rams.h</strong> and comprises just a single function:</p>
<p>int [rams_run]{.underline}(char *mibSource, char *tsorder, char
*applicationName, char *authorityName, char *unitName, char
*roleName, int lifetime);</p>
<p>This function initiates a RAMS gateway operations loop. <em>mibSource</em>,
<em>tsorder</em>, <em>mName</em>, <em>memory</em>, <em>mSize</em>, <em>applicationName</em>,
<em>authorityName</em>, <em>unitName</em>, and <em>roleName</em> are as discussed in the
documentation of [ams_register]{.underline} above; they are used to
register the RAMS gateway process as an AMS module. <em>lifetime</em> is the
user-specified maximum time to live for all DTN bundles issued by the
RAMS gateway in the course of its communications over the RAMS
network.</p>
<p>Note that the priority assigned to any DTN bundle that conveys a
published or privately sent AMS message over the RAMS network will be
computed as a function of the flow label specified at the time the
message was originally published or sent. If no overriding flow label
was specified, then the bundle priority will be 1 (standard).
Otherwise, the number represented by the two low-order bits of the
flow label will be used as the bundle priority and two "extended class
of service" parameters will be derived from the next two higher-order
bits of the flow label: bit 5 (the 3^rd^-lowest-order bit) will be
used as the value of the "minimum latency" flag, with a value of 1
indicating that the bundle is critical, and bit 4 (the
4^th^-lowest-order bit) will be used as the value of the "best-effort"
flag, with a value of 1 indicating that the bundle should be sent over
an unacknowledged convergence-layer protocol. All bundles issued by
the RAMS gateway that don't carry AMS messages will be assigned bundle
priority 1.</p>
<p>This function runs indefinitely until it fails or is interrupted by a
SIGINT signal. Returns -1 on any failure, 0 on normal termination.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="ramsgate">ramsgate</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The sample RAMS gateway program <strong>ramsgate</strong> provides basic RAMS
gateway functionality. To run it, enter a command of the following
form at a terminal window prompt:</p>
<p>ramsgate <em>application_name authority_name_name lifetime</em>
[<em>memory_size</em> [<em>memory_manager_name</em>]]</p>
<p><em>application_name</em>, <em>authority_name</em>, <em>lifetime</em>,
<em>memory_manager_name</em>, and <em>memory_size</em> are as discussed in the
documentation of ams_register. If not specified, memory size defaults
to 200000. The gateway process always registers in the role named
"RAMS".</p>
<p>Note that <strong>ramsgate</strong> relies on the ION implementation of DTN; be
sure an ION node is operating on the local computer before starting
<strong>ramsgate</strong>. (See the ION Design and Operations Guide for details.)</p>
<p>To terminate operation of the gateway process, just use CTRL-C to
interrupt the program.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="management-information-base">Management Information Base</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>In order to operate correctly, every AMS application process -- and
<strong>amsd</strong> as well -- must initially load Management Information Base
(MIB) values that are universally consistent.</p>
<p>Currently this is accomplished automatically during registration: MIB
value declaration commands in XML format are read from a file, parsed,
and processed automatically.</p>
</blockquote>

<h1 id="application-development">Application Development</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>AMS applications (i.e. "modules") are custom software built using AMS'
application programming interface (API). These AMS modules serve as
the interfaces between AMS and mission-specific processes or
applications.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="overview_1">Overview</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>A general overview of the required steps follows this sequence:</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Include the AMS library header file (ams.h) in your application's
   source code</li>
<li>Use the provided AMS library functions to implement the interface
   (to include functionality such as publication and subscription)</li>
<li>Compile your application and link the compiled binary to the
   required library objects (i.e. ici, dgr, ltp, bp)</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="compiling-custom-ams-applications">Compiling Custom AMS Applications</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Applications created with the API must be compiled with links to ION's
dynamic libraries.</p>
<p>The following two-step build procedure provides an example of how this
works (note that the default path for installed ION library files
(Linux) is used: /usr/local/lib/):</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li><em>gcc -g -Wall -Werror -Dlinux -DUDPTS -DTCPTS -DDGRTS -DNOEXPAT
   -fPIC -DSPACE_ORDER=3 -I../library -I../include -I../rams
   -I/usr/local/include -c \&lt;your_module_name&gt;.c</em></li>
<li><em>gcc -g -Wall -Werror -Dlinux -DUDPTS -DTCPTS -DDGRTS -DNOEXPAT
   -fPIC -DSPACE_ORDER=3 -I../library -I../include -I../rams
   -I/usr/local/include -o \&lt;your_module_name&gt; \&lt;your_module_name&gt;.o
   -L./lib -L/usr/local/lib -lams -ldgr -lici -lpthread -lm</em></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="running-the-application">Running the Application</h2>
<p>Applications must self-register with an AMS registrar. To facilitate
this the following information is required by the application (i.e.
using the ams_register() function):</p>
<ol>
<li>unit name</li>
<li>role name</li>
<li>application name</li>
<li>authority name</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Given this requirement, it may be useful (but not necessary) for the
application to accept command line arguments.</p>
<p>An example command to start a custom AMS module might look like the
following:</p>
<p><em>./your_module_name ' ' your_module_mib_role_name amsdemo test</em></p>
<p>Note: the empty quotes (' ') above are used to specify registration
with the root unit registrar.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="a-sample-application">A Sample Application</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>Follows is the complete source code for 'amshello', a simple
Unix-based AMS application installed alongside AMS. It is a complete
distributed system comprising two AMS application modules that
functions as follows.</p>
<p>When the amshello program starts it <em>fork()</em>s into two processes, a
"pitcher" and a "catcher". Both processes then register as modules in
the root cell of an "amsdemo/test" message space. The catcher invites
messages on subject "text" and waits for the first such message to
arrive. The pitcher waits for an invitation to send messages of
subject "text" and, when it arrives, sends one such message and
terminates. When the catcher receives the message it prints the text
of the message and then terminates.</p>
<p>To run the 'amshello' demonstration application the following 2 steps
are required.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>An AMS configuration server and registrar must be started (do this
   after all other ION processes have started) using the following
   command:<em>amsd @ @ amsdemo test \"\" &amp;</em></li>
<li>Then run the amshello application using the following command:
   <em>amshello</em></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Important points regarding the above <em>amsd</em> command (see <em>man amsd</em>
for additional details):</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The first '@' character specifies the use of AMS' in-memory MIB
  (used for demonstration purposes only)</li>
<li>The second '@' character specifies that the daemon will serve as
  both a registrar and configuration server (running at
  127.0.0.1:2357)</li>
<li>The "" parameter specifies that the registrar function as the "root
  unit" registrar</li>
