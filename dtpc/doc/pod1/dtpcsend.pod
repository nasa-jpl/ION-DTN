=head1 NAME

dtpcsend - Delay-Tolerant Payload Conditioning transmission test program

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<dtpcsend> I<nbr_of_cycles> I<rate> I<payload_size> I<topic_ID> I<profile_ID> I<destination_endpoint>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<dtpcsend> uses DTPC to send I<nbr_of_cycles> application data items of 
I<payload_size> bytes each on topic I<topic_ID> to I<destination_endpoint>
using transmission profile I<profile_ID> at I<rate> bits per second.

I<rate> must be between 1000 and 200 million bits per second.

I<payload_size> must be between 2 and 1 million bytes.  To use application data
item sizes chosen at random from the range 1 to 65536, specify I<payload_size>
= 1.

B<NOTE> that B<dtpcsend> invokes an elision function that removes from
the outbound DTPC aggregate ADU all records that are of the same size as
the first record in that aggregation.  This means that specifying any
payload size other than 1 that is less than the configured DTPC aggregation
size limit will cause DTPC to issue ADUs only when the aggregation time
limit is exceeded, and each such ADU will always contain only a single record.

Use CTRL-C to terminate the program.
