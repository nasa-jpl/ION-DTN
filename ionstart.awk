#ionstart.awk

# 20 AUG 2008
#
# This awk script takes, from standard input, a text configuration file.
# The file will contain configuration commands for several ion node
# administration programs.
# Each section will be dilineated by a pair of Marker lines:
## begin programname 
# 	This line will appear at the start of a section.
## end programname
#	This line will appear at the end of a section.
#
# An option is permitted: tag
# Defining "tag" will limit which begin and end lines will match.
# For instance, you can have 2 node's configuration commands in different
# sets of sections, such as:
## begin ionadmin host1
## begin ionadmin host2
# the tag will allow the command to consider only host1's lines.
# A side effect of this is that section coherence will not be checked with
# files containing multiple tags.  This could mean that "host1"'s ionadmin
# section could overlap with "host2"'s bpadmin section, causing errors.
# BUT it can also mean that host1 and host2's ionadmin files both overlap
# completely, saving the user typing time by sending the same topology
# information to both nodes with the same file.
#
# program names accepted are:
# ionadmin ionsecadmin bpsecadmin ltpsecrc ltpadmin bpadmin cfdpadmin ipnadmin bibeadmin dtn2admin dtpcadmin acsadmin imcadmin bssadmin
#
# Program sections may not overlap.
# Lines with unsupported program names will be ignored.
# In the case of an end line immediately following a begin line
# (where there are no lines in between) will result in the program
# not being called.
#
# Optional variable "echo" will, if set, create files for each
# section matching the current tag. It will create the following:
# configfile.tag.ionrc
# configfile.tag.ionsecrc
# configfile.tag.bpsecrc
# configfile.tag.ltpsecrc
# configfile.tag.ltprc
# configfile.tag.bprc
# configfile.tag.cfdprc
# configfile.tag.ipnrc
# configfile.tag.dtn2rc
# configfile.tag.dtpcrc
# configfile.tag.acsrc
# configfile.tag.imcrc
# configfile.tag.bssrc
# it will NOT check for the file existence beforehand.
# it will NOT run the program.
#
# SCRIPT REQUIRES A VARIABLE TO BE SET: configfile
# SCRIPT HAS OPTIONAL VARIABLES: tag echo
