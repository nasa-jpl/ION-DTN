=head1 NAME

bpecho - Bundle Protocol reception test program

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<bpecho> I<ownEndpointId>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<bpecho> uses Bundle Protocol to receive application data units
from a remote B<bpdriver> application task.  In response to each
received application data unit it sends back an "echo" application data
unit of length 2, the NULL-terminated string "x".

B<bpecho> terminates upon receiving the SIGQUIT signal, i.e., ^C from the
keyboard.

will be noted in the B<ion.log> log file.

=item "1"

B<bpecho> has terminated due to a BP reception failure.  Details should be
noted in the B<ion.log> log file.
