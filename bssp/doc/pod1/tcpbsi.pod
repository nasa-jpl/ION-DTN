=head1 NAME

tcpbsi - TCP-based reliable link service input task for BSSP

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<tcpbsi> {I<local_hostname> | @}[:I<local_port_nbr>]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<tcpbsi> is a background "daemon" task that receives TCP stream data via a
TCP socket bound to I<local_hostname> and I<local_port_nbr>, extracts BSSP
blocks from that stream, and passes them to the local BSSP engine.
Host name "@" signifies that the host name returned by hostname(1) is to
be used as the socket's host name.  If not specified, port number defaults
to 4556.

The link service input task is spawned automatically by B<bsspadmin> in
response to the 's' command that starts operation of the BSSP protocol;
the text of the command that is used to spawn the task must be provided
as a parameter to the 's' command.  The link service input task is
terminated by B<bsspadmin> in response to an 'x' (STOP) command.

=head1 EXIT STATUS

=over 4

=item "0"

B<tcpbsi> terminated normally, for reasons noted in the B<ion.log> file.  If
this termination was not commanded, investigate and solve the problem identified
in the log file and use B<bsspadmin> to restart B<tcpbsi>.

=item "1"

B<tcpbsi> terminated abnormally, for reasons noted in the B<ion.log> file.
Investigate and solve the problem identified in the log file, then use
B<bsspadmin> to restart B<tcpbsi>.

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

The following diagnostics may be issued to the B<ion.log> log file:

=over 4

=item tcpbsi can't initialize BSSP.

B<bsspadmin> has not yet initialized BSSP protocol operations.

=item RL-BSI task is already started.

Redundant initiation of B<tcpbsi>.

=item RL-BSI can't open TCP socket

Operating system error.  Check errtext, correct problem, and restart B<tcpbsi>.

=item RL-BSI can't initialize socket

Operating system error.  Check errtext, correct problem, and restart B<tcpbsi>.

=item tcpbsi can't create receiver thread

Operating system error.  Check errtext, correct problem, and restart B<tcpbsi>.
