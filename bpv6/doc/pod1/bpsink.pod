bpsink - Bundle Protocol reception test program

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<bpsink> I<ownEndpointId>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<bpsink> uses Bundle Protocol to receive application data units from a
remote B<bpsource> application task.  For each application data unit it
receives, it prints the ADU's length and -- if length is less than 80 -- its
text.

B<bpsink> terminates upon receiving the SIGQUIT signal, i.e., ^C from the
keyboard.
