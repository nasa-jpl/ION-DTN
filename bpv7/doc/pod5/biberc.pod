biberc - BIBE configuration commands file

=head1 DESCRIPTION

BIBE configuration commands are passed to B<bibeadmin> either in a file of
text lines or interactively at bibeadmin's command prompt (:).  Commands
are interpreted line-by line, with exactly one command per line.

BIBE configuration commands establish the parameters governing transmission
of BIBE PDUs to specified B<peer> nodes: anticipated delivery latency in the
forward direction, anticipated delivery latency in the return direction,
report-to endpoint, bundle status report request flags, TTL for BIBE PDUs,
priority, ordinal priority in the event that priority is Expedited,
quality-of service flags, and (optionally) data label.  As such, they
configure BIBE convergence-layer adapter (B<bcla>) structures.

The formats and effects of the BIBE configuration commands are described below.

NOTE: in order to cause bundles to be transmitted via BIBE:

=over 4

=item B<Plan>

Remember that BIBE is a convergence-layer protocol; as such, it operates
between two nodes that are topologically adjacent in a BP network (but in
this case the BP network within which the nodes are topologically adjacent
is an overlay on top of the real BP network).  Since the sending and
receiving nodes are topologically adjacent, they are neighbors: the sending
node MUST have an egress plan for transmission to the receiving (that is,
peer) node, and there MUST be a BIBE outduct attached to that plan.  The
affected bundles will be encapsulated within BIBE bundles (BIBE protocol
data units, or BPDUs) by the BIBE convergence-layer output daemon
(B<bibeclo>), which will obtain all forwarding parameters from the bcla
for the peer node as established by bibeadmin.

=item B<Routing>

In order to compel bundles to be forwarded via the BIBE peer node rather
than over some other route computed by CGR, you have to override CGR routing
for that bundle.  This is done in node administration: use ipnadmin to
establish at the BIBE sending node a I<routing override> that coerces all
bundles characterized by specified data label, destination, and/or source
to be sent directly to the peer node by means of the BIBE outduct attached
to that node's egress plan.

=item B<Quality of Service>

If you want custody transfer to be invoked for BIBE transmissions
from the sending node to the peer node, set the BP_CT_REQUESTED
flag to 1 in the I<qosFlags> of the bcla for the peer node as
configured by bibeadmin.  This can be done by OR'ing BP_CT_REQUESTED
(which has the value 64) with the other values in qosFlags.

=head1 GENERAL COMMANDS

=over 4

=item B<?>

The B<help> command.  This will display a listing of the commands and their
formats.  It is the same as the B<h> command.

=item B<#>

Comment line.  Lines beginning with B<#> are not interpreted.

=item B<e> { 1 | 0 }

Echo control.  Setting echo to 1 causes all output printed by bibeadmin to be
logged as well as sent to stdout.  Setting echo to 0 disables this behavior.

=item B<w> { 0 | 1 | I<activity_spec> }

The B<watch> command.  This command enables and disables production of a
continuous stream of user-selected Bundle-in-Bundle Encapsulation
custody transfer activity indication characters.  A watch parameter of "1"
selects all BIBE-CT activity indication characters; "0" de-selects all
BIBE-CT activity indication characters; any other I<activity_spec> such
as "mw" selects all activity indicators in the string, de-selecting all
others.  BIBE will print each selected activity indication character to
B<stdout> every time a processing event of the associated type occurs:

B<w>	custody of bundle is accepted

B<m>	custody acceptance is received for one bundle

B<x>	custody of bundle is refused

B<&>	custody refusal is received for one bundle

B<$>	bundle retransmitted due to expired custodial retransmission interval

=item B<h>

The B<help> command.  This will display a listing of the commands and their
formats.  It is the same as the B<?> command.

=head1 BCLA COMMANDS

=over 4

=item B<a> bcla I<peer_EID> I<fwd_latency> I<rtn_latency> I<rptTo> I<bundle_status_report_request_flags> I<time_to_live> I<priority> I<ordinal> I<qosFlags> [I<data label>]

The B<add bcla> command.  This command adds the neighboring node identified
by I<peer_EID> as a BIBE destination of the local node.

=item B<c> bcla I<peer_EID> I<fwd_latency> I<rtn_latency> I<rptTo> I<bundle_status_report_request_flags> I<time_to_live> I<priority> I<ordinal> I<qosFlags> [I<data label>]

The B<change bcla> command.  This command changes the transmission parameters
governing BIBE PDU transmission to the indicated peer node.

=item B<d> bcla I<peer_EID>

The B<delete bcla> command.  This command deletes the B<bcla> identified by
I<peer_EID>.

=item B<i> bcla I<peer_EID>

This command will print information (the transmission parameters) for the
BIBE peer node identified by I<peer_EID>.

=item B<l>

This command lists all of the local node's BIBE peers.

=head1 EXAMPLES

=over 4

=item a bcla ipn:3.2 10 10 dtn:none 0 60 1 0 0 16

Declares that ipn:3.2 is a BIBE peer and that BIBE PDUs destined for this
node are to be sent with TTL 60 seconds, priority 1 (standard), and data
label 16; no bundle status reporting is required for these bundles and it
is expected that BIBE PDUs sent to this node will arrive within 10 seconds
and that BIBE PDUs sent from this node will arrive within 10 seconds.
