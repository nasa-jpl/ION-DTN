#	Ohio University, Oct 2008

# Initialization command (command 1). 
# Establishes the LTP retransmission window. 
# (Prohibiting LTP from seizing all available storage).
#	A maximum of 32 sessions.  A session is assumed to be around one
#	second of transmission.  This value should be estimated at the sum
#	of maximum round-trip times (in seconds) for all "spans."
#	Suggest throwing 20% higher number of sessions to account for extra-
#	long sessions which contain an actual retransmission.
1 32

# Add a span. (a connection) 
#	Identify the span as engine number 1.
#	Use 1400 byte segments (assuming a standard ethernet frame
#	underlying this link and accounting for ip/udp/eth header overhead).
#	Use a nominal block size of 10000 bytes.  This is the amount of data
#	(which can span several bundles) sent in a session.  You should
#	consider this to be the maximum number of bytes sent in one second
#	on the link. (you can also use the block size limit in the
#	initialization command).
#	Use the command 'udplso 10.1.1.1:1113' to implement the link
#	itself.  In this case, we use udp to connect to the local machine
#	(loopback) using port 1113 (defined by IANA as the default UDP port
#	for Licklider Transmission Protocol).  The single quote is
#	important, don't use double quotes.
a span 1 1400 10000 'udplso 10.1.1.1:1113'

# Add another span. (to yourself) 
#	Identify the span as engine number 2.
#	Use the command 'udplso 10.1.1.2:1113' to implement the link
#	itself.  In this case, we use udp to connect to host2 using the
#	default port.
a span 2 1400 10000 'udplso 10.1.1.2:1113'

# Start command.
#	This command actually runs the link service output commands
#	(defined above, in the "a span" commands).
#	Also starts the link service INPUT task 'udplsi 10.1.1.2:1113' to
#	listen locally on UDP port 1113 for incoming LTP traffic.

## begin bpadmin 
# bprc configuration file for host2 in a 3node ltp/stcp test.
#	Command: % bpadmin host2.bprc
#	This command should be run AFTER ionadmin and ltpadmin and 
#	BEFORE ipnadmin or dtnadmin.
#
#	Ohio University, Oct 2008

# Initialization command (command 1).
#	Use ipn:2.0 as the custodian endpoint of this node.
#	That is, scheme IPN with element_number 2 and service number 0
#	(ipn requires custodian service is zero).
#	Note that this EID must be understood by the node itself, so be sure
#	to add the scheme below.
1 ipn:2.0

# Add an EID scheme.
#	The scheme's name is ipn.
#	The scheme's number is 1.  Note that this number is defined for
#	Compressed Bundle Header Encoding (CBHE) schemes ONLY.  All other
#	schemes (dtn for example) should use number -1.
#	This scheme's forwarding engine is handled by the program 'ipnfw.'
#	This scheme's administration program (acting as the custodian
#	daemon) is 'ipnadminep.'
a scheme ipn 1 'ipnfw' 'ipnadminep'

# Add endpoints.
#	Establish endpoints ipn:2.0 ipn:2.1 and ipn:2.2 on the local node.
#	ipn:2.0 is expected for custodian traffic.  The rest are usually
#	used for specific applications (such as bpsink).
#	The behavior for receiving a bundle when there is no application
#	currently accepting bundles, is to queue them 'q', as opposed to
#	immediately and silently discarding them (use 'x' instead of 'q' to
#	discard).

# Add an induct. (listen)
#	Add an induct to accept bundles using the ltp protocol.

#	TCP convergence layer port.

# Add an outduct. (send to yourself)
#	Add an outduct to send bundles using the stcp protocol.

#	IANA assigned default DTN TCP port of 4556.
#	The outduct itself is implemented by the 'stcpclo' command.

# Add an outduct. (send to host3)
#	Add an outduct to send bundles using the stcp protocol.

# Add an outduct. (send to host1)
#	Add an outduct to send bundles using the ltp protocol.
