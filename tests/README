Directory layout
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This directory contains the test suite.  Each test lives in its own
subdirectory of this directory.  Each test is implemented by a script
named "$TESTNAME/dotest".


Exclude files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Exclude files are hidden files that allow for tests to be disabled based
on certain conditions that may cause the test to not run properly. If an
exclude file exists, it should have a short message about why the test has
been excluded.

Exclude files can exist in any of the following formats:

.exclude_OS-TYPE    : Disables a test for an operating system that it does
		      not run successfully on. Acceptable values to fill in
		      for OS-TYPE are "windows", "linux", "mac", and "solaris"
.exclude_BP-VERSION : Disables a test for a version of the bundle protocol
		      that it does not run correctly or does not make sense
		      with. As of ION 4.0.0, the acceptable values to fill in
		      for BP-VERSION are "bpv6" and "bpv7".
.exclude_all	    : Disables a test for all platforms.
.exclude_expert     : Disables a test because of additional utilities that are
		      required for the test. To work around this exclusion if
		      you want to run an expert test, you can set
		      ION_RUN_EXPERT="yes" in your shell environment to
		      enable all ION tests classified as expert.
.exclude_cbased     : Disables a test that relys on compiling a C program to
		      generate the dotest executable script. If you want to
		      exclude C based tests, you need to define the environment
		      variable ION_EXCLUDE_CBASED.


Running the tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The tests are run by running "make test-all" in the top-level directory,
or by running "runtests" in this directory.

An individual test can also be run:

	./runtests test_name

A file defining a set of tests can be run with runtestset.  The arguments
to runtestset are files that contain globs of tests to run:

    ./runtestset quicktests


Writing new tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A test directory must contain an executable file named "dotest".  If a
directory does not contain this, then the test directory is ignored.

The dotest program should execute the test, possibly reporting runtime
information on stdout and stderr, and indicate by its return value the
status of the test:

    0: Success

    1: Failure

    2: Skip this test

The test program starts without the ION stack running.  The test program
is responsible for starting the ION stack in the way it wants to test.
The test program *must* stop the ION stack before returning.


The test environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The tests' dotest scripts are run in their test directory.

The following environment variables are set as indicated:

    IONDIR is the root of the local ION source directory

    PATH begins with IONDIR (this is where the local executables are
    found)
