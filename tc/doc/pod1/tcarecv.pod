=head1 NAME

tcarecv - Trusted Collective daemon task for receiving newly generated records of critical information

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<tcarecv> I<blocks_group_number>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<tcarecv> is a background "daemon" task that receives new critical
information records multicast by user nodes of the TC application identified
by I<blocks_group_number>.  It records those assertions in a database for
future processing by B<tcacompile>.  It is spawned automatically by
B<tcaadmin> in response to the 's' command that starts operation of
the TC authority function for this application on the local node, and
it is terminated by B<tcaadmin> in response to an 'x' (STOP) command.

=head1 EXIT STATUS

=over 4

=item "0"

B<tcarecv> terminated, for reasons noted in the B<ion.log> file.  If this
termination was not commanded, investigate and solve the problem identified
in the log file and use B<tcaadmin> to restart B<tcarecv>.

=item "1"

B<tcarecv> was unable to attach to DTKA operations, probably because
B<tcaadmin> has not yet been run.
