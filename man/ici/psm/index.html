<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>PSM is a library of functions that support personal space management,<br />
that is, user management of an application-configured
memory partition.  PSM is designed to be faster and more efficient<br />
than malloc/free (for details, see the DETAILED DESCRIPTION below), but
more importantly it provides a memory management
abstraction that insulates applications from differences in the
management of private versus shared memory.  </p>
<p>PSM is often used to manage shared memory partitions.  On most
operating systems, separate tasks that connect to a common
shared memory partition are given the same base address with
which to access the partition.  On some systems (such as Solaris)
this is not necessarily the case; an absolute address within
such a shared partition will be mapped to different pointer values in
different tasks.  If a pointer value is stored within shared
memory and used without conversion by multiple tasks, segment violations
will occur.</p>
<p>PSM gets around this problem by providing functions for translating<br />
between local pointer values and relative addresses within the shared memory
partition.  For complete portability, applications which store
addresses in shared memory should store these addresses as PSM
relative addresses and convert them to local pointer values before
using them.  The PsmAddress data type is provided for this purpose, 
along with the conversion functions psa() and psp().</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>int  psm_manage(char *start, unsigned int length, char *name, PsmPartition *partitionPointer, PsmMgtOutcome *outcome)</p>
<p>Puts the <em>length</em> bytes of memory at <em>start</em> under PSM management,
associating this memory partition with the identifying string <em>name</em>
(which is required and which can have a maximum string length of
31).  PSM can manage any contiguous range of addresses to which the
application has access, typically a block of heap memory
returned by a malloc call.</p>
<p>Every other PSM API function must be passed a pointer to a local "partition"
state structure characterizing the PSM-managed memory to which the function
is to be applied.  The partition state structure itself may be pre-allocated
in static or local (or shared) memory by the application, in which
case a pointer to that structure must be passed to psm_manage() as
the value of <em>*partitionPointer</em>; if <em>*partitionPointer</em> is null,
psm_manage() will use malloc() to allocate this structure dynamically
from local memory and will store a pointer to the structure in
<em>*partitionPointer</em>.</p>
<p>psm_manage() formats the managed memory as necessary and returns -1 on any
error, 0 otherwise.  The outcome to the attempt to manage memory is placed
in <em>outcome</em>.  An outcome of Redundant means that the memory at <em>start</em>
is already under PSM management with the same name and size.  An outcome
of Refused means that PSM was unable to put the memory at <em>start</em> under
PSM management as directed; a diagnostic message was posted to the message
pool (see discussion of putErrmsg() in platform(3)).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>char *psm_name(PsmPartition partition)</p>
<p>Returns the name associated with the partition at the time it was put
under management.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>char *psm_space(PsmPartition partition)</p>
<p>Returns the address of the space managed by PSM for <em>partition</em>.
This function is provided to enable the application to do an
operating-system release (such as free()) of this memory when
the managed partition is no longer needed.  <em>NOTE</em> that calling
psm_erase() or psm_unmanage() [or any other PSM function, for that
matter] after releasing that space is virtually guaranteed to result
in a segmentation fault or other seriously bad behavior.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>void *psp(PsmPartition partition, PsmAddress address)</p>
<p><em>address</em> is an offset within the space managed for the partition.  Returns
the conversion of that offset into a locally usable pointer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>PsmAddress psa(PsmPartition partition, void *pointer)</p>
<p>Returns the conversion of <em>pointer</em> into an offset within the space
managed for the partition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>PsmAddress psm_malloc(PsmPartition partition,  unsigned int length)</p>
<p>Allocates a block of memory from the "large pool" of
the indicated partition.  (See the DETAILED DESCRIPTION below.)  <em>length</em>
is the size of the block to allocate; the maximum size is 1/2 of the total
address space (i.e., 2G for a 32-bit machine).  Returns
NULL if no free block could be found.  The block returned 
is aligned on a doubleword boundary.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>void psm_panic(PsmPartition partition)</p>
<p>Forces the "large pool" memory allocation algorithm to
hunt laboriously for free blocks in buckets that may
not contain any.  This setting remains in force for the
indicated  partition until a subsequent psm_relax() call reverses it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>void psm_relax(PsmPartition partition)</p>
<p>Reverses psm_panic().  Lets the "large pool" memory allocation<br />
algorithm return NULL when no free block can be found easily.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>PsmAddress psm_zalloc(PsmPartition partition,  unsigned int length)</p>
<p>Allocates a block of memory from the "small pool" of
the indicated partition, if possible; if the requested
block size -- <em>length</em> -- is too large for small pool
allocation (which is limited to 64 words, i.e., 256 bytes for a
32-bit machine), or if no small pool space is available
and the size of the small pool cannot be increased,
then allocates from the large pool instead.  Small pool
allocation is performed by an especially speedy algorithm, and 
minimum space is consumed in memory management<br />
overhead for small-pool blocks.  Returns NULL if no free block could be
found.  The block returned is aligned on a word boundary.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>void psm_free(PsmPartition partition, PsmAddress block)</p>
<p>Frees for subsequent re-allocation the indicated block
of memory from the indicated partition.  <em>block</em> may
have been allocated by either psm_malloc() or psm_zalloc().</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>int psm_set_root(PsmPartition partition, PsmAddress root)</p>
<p>Sets the "root" word of the indicated partition (a word
at a fixed, private location in the PSM bookkeeping
data area) to the indicated value.  This function is
typically useful in a shared-memory environment, such
as a VxWorks address space, in which a task wants to
retrieve from the indicated partition some data that was inserted 
into the partition by some other task; the partition root 
word enables multiple tasks to navigate the
same data in the same PSM partition in shared memory.
The argument is normally a pointer to something like a
linked list of the linked lists that populate the partition;
in particular, it is likely to be an object catalog
(see psm_add_catlg()).  Returns 0 on success, -1 on any
failure (e.g., the partition already has a root object, in which
case psm_erase_root() must be called before psm_set_root()).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>PsmAddress psm_get_root(PsmPartition partition)</p>
<p>Retrieves the current value of the root word of the indicated partition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>void psm_erase_root(PsmPartition partition)</p>
<p>Erases the current value of the root word of the indicated partition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>PsmAddress psm_add_catlg(PsmPartition partition)</p>
<p>Allocates space for an object catalog in the indicated partition
and establishes the new catalog as the partition's root object.  Returns
0 on success, -1 on any error (e.g., the partition already has
some other root object).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>int psm_catlg(PsmPartition partition, char *objName, PsmAddress objLocation)</p>
<p>Inserts an entry for the indicated object into the catalog that is the root
object for this partition.  The length of <em>objName</em> cannot exceed 32 bytes,
and <em>objName</em> must be unique in the catalog.  Returns 0 on success, -1 on
any error.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>int psm_uncatlg(PsmPartition partition, char *objName)</p>
<p>Removes the entry for the named object from the catalog that is the root
object for this partition, if that object is found in the catalog.  Returns
0 on success, -1 on any error.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>int psm_locate(PsmPartition partition, char *objName, PsmAddress *objLocation, PsmAddress *entryElt)</p>
<p>Places in <em>*objLocation</em> the address associated with <em>objName</em> in the
catalog that is the root object for this partition and places in <em>*entryElt</em>
the address of the list element that points to this catalog entry.  If <em>name</em>
is not found in catalog, set <em>*entryElt</em> to zero.  Returns 0 on success, -1
on any error.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>void psm_usage(PsmPartition partition, PsmUsageSummary *summary)</p>
<p>Loads the indicated PsmUsageSummary structure with a
snapshot of the indicated partition's usage status.
PsmUsageSummary is defined by:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>typedef struct {
    char            partitionName[32];
    unsigned int    partitionSize;
    unsigned int    smallPoolSize;
    unsigned int    smallPoolFreeBlockCount[SMALL_SIZES];
    unsigned int    smallPoolFree;
    unsigned int    smallPoolAllocated;
    unsigned int    largePoolSize;
    unsigned int    largePoolFreeBlockCount[LARGE_ORDERS];
    unsigned int    largePoolFree;
    unsigned int    largePoolAllocated;
    unsigned int    unusedSize;
} PsmUsageSummary;
</code></pre></div>
</li>
<li>
<p>void psm_report(PsmUsageSummary *summary)</p>
<p>Sends to stdout the content of <em>summary</em>,
a snapshot of a partition's usage status.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>void psm_unmanage(PsmPartition partition)</p>
<p>Terminates local PSM management of the memory in <em>partition</em> and
destroys the partition state structure <em>*partition</em>,
but doesn't erase anything in the managed memory; PSM
management can be re-established by a subsequent call to psm_manage().</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>void psm_erase(PsmPartition partition)</p>
<p>Unmanages the indicated partition and additionally discards all information
in the managed memory, preventing re-management of the partition.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="memory-usage-tracing">MEMORY USAGE TRACING</h1>
<p>If PSM_TRACE is defined at the time the PSM source code is compiled, the
system includes built-in support for simple tracing of memory usage: memory
allocations are logged, and memory deallocations are matched to logged
allocations, "closing" them.  This enables memory leaks and some other
kinds of memory access problems to be readily investigated.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>int psm_start_trace(PsmPartition partition, int traceLogSize, char *traceLogAddress)</p>
<p>Begins an episode of PSM memory usage tracing.  <em>traceLogSize</em> is the
number of bytes of shared memory to use for trace activity logging; the
frequency with which "closed" trace log events must be deleted will vary
inversely with the amount of memory allocated for the trace log.
<em>traceLogAddress</em> is normally NULL, causing the trace system to allocate
<em>traceLogSize</em> bytes of shared memory dynamically for trace logging; if
non-NULL, it must point to <em>traceLogSize</em> bytes of shared memory that
have been pre-allocated by the application for this purpose.  Returns 0 on
success, -1 on any failure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>void psm_print_trace(PsmPartition partition, int verbose)</p>
<p>Prints a cumulative trace report and current usage report for 
<em>partition</em>.  If <em>verbose</em> is zero, only exceptions (notably, trace
log events that remain open -- potential memory leaks) are printed;
otherwise all activity in the trace log is printed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>void psm_clear_trace(PsmPartition partition)</p>
<p>Deletes all closed trace log events from the log, freeing up memory for
additional tracing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>void psm_stop_trace(PsmPartition partition)</p>
<p>Ends the current episode of PSM memory usage tracing.  If the shared
memory used for the trace log was allocated by psm_start_trace(), releases
that shared memory.</p>
</li>

<p>Compiling a PSM application</p>
<p>Just be sure to "#include "psm.h"" at the top of each source file

</li>
<li>
<p>Linking/loading a PSM application</p>
<p>a. In a UNIX environment, link with libpsm.a.</p>
<p>b. In a VxWorks environment, use</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>  ld 1, 0, &quot;libpsm.o&quot;
</code></pre></div>
<p>to load PSM on the target before loading any PSM applications.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Typical usage:</p>
<p>a. Call psm_manage() to initiate management of the partition.</p>
<p>b. Call psm_malloc() (and/or psm_zalloc()) to allocate space in the 
partition; call psm_free() to release space for later re-allocation.</p>
<p>c. When psm_malloc() returns NULL and you're willing to wait
a while for a more exhaustive free block search, call
psm_panic() before retrying psm_malloc().  When you're no
longer so desperate for space, call psm_relax().</p>
<p>d. To store a vital pointer in the single predefined location<br />
in the partition that PSM reserves for this purpose, call 
psm_set_root(); to retrieve that pointer, call psm_get_root().</p>
<p>e. To get a snapshot of the current configuration of the partition,<br />
call psm_usage().  To print this snapshot to stdout, call psm_report().</p>
<p>f. When you're done with the partition but want to leave
it in its current state for future re-management (e.g.,

<h1 id="detailed-description">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>PSM supports user management of an application-configured memory
partition. The partition is functionally divided into two pools
of variable size: a "small pool" of low-overhead blocks aligned
on 4-byte boundaries that can each contain up to 256 bytes of
user data, and a "large pool" of high-overhead blocks aligned on
8-byte boundaries that can each contain up to 2GB of user data.</p>
<p>Space in the small pool is allocated in any one of 64 different
block sizes; each possible block size is (4i + n) where i is a
"block list index" from 1 through 64 and n is the length of the
PSM overhead information per block [4 bytes on a 32-bit machine].
Given a user request for a block of size q where q is in the
range 1 through 256 inclusive, we return the first block on the
j'th small-pool free list where j = (q - 1) / 4.  If there is no
such block, we increase the size of the small pool [incrementing
its upper limit by (4 * (j + 1)) + n], initialize the increase as
a free block from list j, and return that block.  No attempt is
made to consolidate physically adjacent blocks when they are
freed or to bisect large blocks to satisfy requests for small
ones; if there is no free block of the requested size and the
size of the small pool cannot be increased without encroaching on
the large pool (or if the requested size exceeds 256), we attempt
to allocate a large-pool block as described below.  The differences 
between small-pool and large-pool blocks are transparent to
the user, and small-pool and large-pool blocks can be freely intermixed 
in an application.</p>
<p>Small-pool blocks are allocated and freed very rapidly, and space
overhead consumption is small, but capacity per block is limited
and space assigned to small-pool blocks of a given size is never
again available for any other purpose.  The small pool is
designed to satisfy requests for allocation of a stable overall
population of small, volatile objects such as List and ListElt
structures (see lyst(3)).</p>
<p>Space in the large pool is allocated from any one of 29 buckets,
one for each power of 2 in the range 8 through 2G.  The size of
each block can be expressed as (n + 8i + m) where i is any integer 
in the range 1 through 256M, n is the size of the block's
leading overhead area [8 bytes on a 32-bit machine], and m is the
size of the block's trailing overhead area [also 8 bytes on a
32-bit machine].  Given a user request for a block of size q
where q is in the range 1 through 2G inclusive, we first compute
r as the smallest multiple of 8 that is greater than or equal to
q.  We then allocate the first block in bucket t such that 2 **
(t + 3) is the smallest power of 2 that is greater than r [or, if
r is a power of 2, the first block in bucket t such that 2 ** (t
+ 3) = r].  That is, we try to allocate blocks of size 8 from
bucket 0 [2**3 = 8], blocks of size 16 from bucket 1 [2**4 = 16],
blocks of size 24 from bucket 2 [2**5 = 32, 32 &gt; 24], blocks of
size 32 from bucket 2 [2**5 = 32], and so on.  t is the first
bucket whose free blocks are ALL guaranteed to be at least as
large as r; bucket t - 1 may also contain some blocks that are as
large as r (e.g., bucket 1 will contain blocks of size 24 as well
as blocks of size 16), but we would have to do a possibly time
consuming sequential search through the free blocks in that bucket 
to find a match, because free blocks within a bucket are
stored in no particular order.</p>
<p>If bucket t is empty, we allocate the first block from the first
non-empty bucket corresponding to a greater power of two; if all
eligible bucket are empty, we increase the size of the large pool
[decrementing its lower limit by (r + 16)], initialize the increase 
as a free block and "free" it, and try again.  If the size
of the large pool cannot be increased without encroaching on the
small pool, then if we are desperate we search sequentially
through all blocks in bucket t - 1 (some of which may be of size
r or greater) and allocate the first block that is big enough, if
any.  Otherwise, no block is returned.</p>
<p>Having selected a free block to allocate, we remove the allocated
block from the free list, split off as a new free block all bytes
in excess of (r + 16) bytes [unless that excess is too small to
form a legal-size block], and return the remainder to the user.
When a block is freed, it is automatically consolidated with the
physically preceding block (if that block is free) and the physically 
subsequent block (if that block is free).</p>
<p>Large-pool blocks are allocated and freed quite rapidly; capacity
is effectively unlimited; space overhead consumption is very high
for extremely small objects but becomes an insignificant fraction
of block size as block size increases.  The large pool is
designed to serve as a general-purpose heap with minimal fragmentation 
whose overhead is best justified when used to store relatively 
large, long-lived objects such as image packets.</p>
<p>The general goal of this memory allocation scheme is to satisfy
memory management requests rapidly and yet minimize the chance of
refusing a memory allocation request when adequate unused space
exists but is inaccessible (because it is fragmentary or is
buried as unused space in a block that is larger than necessary).
The size of a small-pool block delivered to satisfy a request for
q bytes will never exceed q + 3 (alignment), plus 4 bytes of
overhead.  The size of a large-pool block delivered to satisfy a
request for q bytes will never exceed q + 7 (alignment) + 20 (the
maximum excess that can't be split off as a separate free block),
plus 16 bytes of overhead.</p>
<p>Neither the small pool nor the large pool ever decrease in size,
but large-pool space previously allocated and freed is available
for small-pool allocation requests if no small-pool space is
available.  Small-pool space previously allocated and freed cannot 
easily be reassigned to the large pool, though, because
blocks in the large pool must be physically contiguous to support
defragmentation.  No such reassignment algorithm has yet been developed.</p>
