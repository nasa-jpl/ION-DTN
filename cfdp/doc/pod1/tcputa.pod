tcputa - TCP/IP-based CFDP UT-layer adapter

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<tcputa>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<tcputa> is a background "daemon" task that sends and receives CFDP PDUs
via a TCP/IP socket.

The task is spawned automatically by B<cfdpadmin> in response to the 's'
command that starts operation of the CFDP protocol; the text of the
command that is used to spawn the task must be provided
as a parameter to the 's' command.  The UT-layer daemon is
terminated by B<cfdpadmin> in response to an 'x' (STOP) command.

=head1 EXIT STATUS

=item "0"

this termination was not commanded, investigate and solve the problem identified
in the log file and use B<cfdpadmin> to restart B<tcputa>.

=item "1"
