/**
 * @file metadata.h
 * @brief File handling and metadata processing functions for "embedding" metadata
 * during file transfers: includes encryption flags, time, versioning, file name, 
 * and aux command strings
 *
 * This file contains function prototypes and structures for handling file metadata, including
 * the serialization and deserialization of metadata, generating unique filenames,
 * checking file existence, and writing data to files. It provides comprehensive
 * support for file metadata operations, from creating and parsing metadata buffers
 * to file content processing and utility functions for string manipulation and time
 * calculation. The primary data structure used for handling metadata is the Metadata
 * struct.
 *
 * @details
 * Structs:
 * - Metadata: Stores information about a file, including name, type, content, and
 *   size.
 * 
 * Core Functions:
 * - createBufferFromMetadata: Serializes metadata into a buffer.
 * - extractMetadataFromFile: Extracts metadata from a file into a Metadata structure.
 * - writeMetaDataContentToFile: Writes metadata content to a file.
 * - writeBufferToFile: Writes a buffer to a file.
 * 
 * Metadata and Buffer Processing:
 * - htonll: Converts a 64-bit value from host to network byte order.
 * - ntohll: Converts a 64-bit value from network to host byte order.
 * - getCurrentTimeMs: Retrieves the current system time in milliseconds.
 * - calculateTimeDifference: Calculates the time difference in milliseconds.
 *
 * File and String Utilities:
 * - fileExists: Checks if a specified file exists.
 * - generateNewFilename: Generates a new filename to avoid name clashes.
 * - generateRandomString: Generates a random string of a specified size.
 * - createUniqueFile: Creates uniquely named file.
 * - appendNullChar: Appends a null character to an array.
 * - stripLeadingWhiteSpace: Removes leading whitespace from a string.
 * - isOnlyWhitespace: Checks if a string contains only whitespace.
 * - parseCommandString: Parses a command string into an array of tokens.
 * - executeAndFreeCommands: Prints commands and frees the memory allocated for them.
 * - myStrdup: _POSIX_C_SOURCE 200112L compatible version of strdup().
 *
 *
 * @note This file is essential for handling file metadata within the context of file
 *       transfers, providing a robust set of functionalities for various file and
 *       metadata operations.
 * 
 * @warning Proper error handling and memory management are crucial in these functions
 *          to ensure data integrity and avoid potential memory leaks or data corruption.

 * integer in milliseconds since the Unix Epoch.
 *
 * @var aux_command_length
 * Length of the auxiliary command in this metadata, indicating the `aux_command`
 * array size. Size is a size_t value and may vary by operating system.
 *
 * @var aux_command
 * Pointer to an array of unsigned characters for an auxiliary command
 * associated with the file, length determined by `aux_command_length`.
 *
 * @var filetypeLength
 * Length of the file type information in this metadata, indicating the

 *
 * @var filetype
 * Pointer to an array of unsigned characters for the file type (e.g.,

 * array size. Supports variable-length file contents.
 *
 * @var fileContent
 * Pointer to an array of unsigned characters for the file content, length
