=head1 NAME

tcacompile - Trusted Collective daemon task for compiling critical information bulletins

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<tcacompile> I<blocks_group_number>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<tcacompile> is a background "daemon" task that periodically generates new
proposed bulletins of recent critical information records and multicasts those
bulletins to all nodes in the collective authority for the TC application
identified by I<blocks_group_number>.  It is spawned automatically by
B<tcaadmin> in response to the 's' command that starts operation of the
TC authority function for this application on the local node, and it is
terminated by B<tcaadmin> in response to an 'x' (STOP) command.

=head1 EXIT STATUS

=over 4

=item "0"

B<tcacompile> terminated, for reasons noted in the B<ion.log> file.  If this
termination was not commanded, investigate and solve the problem identified
in the log file and use B<tcaadmin> to restart B<tcacompile>.

=item "1"

B<tcacompile> was unable to attach to TC authority operations, probably because
B<tcaadmin> has not yet been run.
