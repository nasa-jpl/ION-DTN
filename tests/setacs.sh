# SET ACS
#
# bpversion(1) is used before looking for acsadmin(1). While acsadmin(1)
# should not be in BPV7, build errors can build it in BPV7 or PATH errors
# can provide a path to acsadmin(1) within BPV7 on a host with multiple
# BP versions. Because of this, testing for the absence of acsadmin(1) as
# proof that a script is running in BPV7 can incorrectly use acsadmin(1).
#
# This ACS determination block is intended to be universally applicable
# for all tests BUT IT REQUIRES the comment character "#" be removed
# from or added to the exit line and the echo line that precedes it in
# the if-then-else blocks as appropriate for a specific test.
