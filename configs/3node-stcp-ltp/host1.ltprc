# ltprc configuration file for host1 in a 3node ltp/tcp test.
#	Command: % ltpadmin host1.ltprc
#	This command should be run AFTER ionadmin and BEFORE bpadmin.

#	Ohio University, Oct 2008

# Initialization command (command 1). 
# Establishes the LTP retransmission window. 
# (Prohibiting LTP from seizing all available storage).
#	A maximum of 32 sessions.  A session is assumed to be around one
#	second of transmission.  This value should be estimated at the sum
#	of maximum round-trip times (in seconds) for all "spans."
#	Suggest throwing 20% higher number of sessions to account for extra-
#	long sessions which contain an actual retransmission.

# Add a span. (a connection) 
#	Identify the span as engine number 1.
#	Use 1400 byte segments (assuming a standard ethernet frame
#	underlying this link and accounting for ip/udp/eth header overhead).
#	Use a nominal block size of 10000 bytes.  This is the amount of data
#	(which can span several bundles) sent in a session.  You should
#	consider this to be the maximum number of bytes sent in one second
#	on the link. (you can also use the block size limit in the
#	initialization command).
#	Use the command 'udplso 10.1.1.1:1113' to implement the link
#	itself.  In this case, we use udp to connect to the local machine
#	(loopback) using port 1113 (defined by IANA as the default UDP port
#	for Licklider Transmission Protocol).  The single quote is
#	important, don't use double quotes.

# Add another span. (to host2) 
#	Identify the span as engine number 2.
#	Use the command 'udplso 10.1.1.2:1113' to implement the link
#	itself.  In this case, we use udp to connect to host2 using the
#	default port.

# Start command.
#	This command actually runs the link service output commands
#	(defined above, in the "a span" commands).
#	Also starts the link service INPUT task 'udplsi 10.1.1.1:1113' to
#	listen locally on UDP port 1113 for incoming LTP traffic.
