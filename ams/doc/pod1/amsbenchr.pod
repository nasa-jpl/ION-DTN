=head1 NAME

amsbenchr - Asynchronous Message Service (AMS) benchmarking meter

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<amsbenchr>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<amsbenchr> is a test program that simply subscribes to subject "bench"
and receives messages published by B<amsbenchs> until all messages in the
test - as indicated by the count of remaining messages, in in the first
four bytes of each message - have been received.  Then it stops receiving
messages, calculates and prints performance statistics, and terminates.

B<amsbenchr> will register as an application module in the root unit of
the venture identified by application name "amsdemo" and authority name
"test".  A configuration server for the local continuum and a registrar
for the root unit of that venture (which may both be instantiated in a
single B<amsd> daemon task) must be running in order for B<amsbenchr> to
commence operations.

=item -1

B<amsbenchr> failed, for reasons noted in the ion.log file.
