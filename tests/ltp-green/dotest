# Tests LTP unacknowledged (green) transmission.  This test is the
# counterpart to ltp-retransmission: there is no retransmission of
# data in "green" blocks, so data loss due to UDP congestion will be
# reflected in incomplete delivery.  However, in the absence of data
# loss even large bundles may be sent in "green" blocks.  We force
# data lost on the path from node 2 to node 3 by interposing a owltsim
# task that discards 1/4 of the UDP datagrams it receives; on the
# path from node 3 to node 2 there is no such artificial data loss
# and therefore the bundle we send on this path should arrive.
