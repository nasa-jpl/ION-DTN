=head1 NAME

bibeclo - BP convergence layer output task using bundle-in-bundle encapsulation

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<bibeclo> I<peer_EID>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<bibeclo> is a background "daemon" task that extracts bundles from the
queues of bundles that are ready for transmission via bundle-in-bundle
encapsulation (BIBE) to I<peer_EID>, encapsulates them in BP administrative
records of (non-standard) record type 7 (BP_BIBE_PDU), and sends those
administrative records in encapsulating bundles destined for I<peer_EID>.  The
forwarding of BPDUs for which custodial acknowledgment is configured
causes B<bibeclo> to post
custodial re-forwarding timers to the node's timeline.  Parameters governing
the forwarding of BIBE PDUs to I<peer_EID> are stipulated in the corresponding
BIBE convergence-layer adapter (B<bcla>) structure residing in the BIBE
database, as managed by B<bibeadmin>.

The receiving node is expected to process received BIBE PDUs by simply
dispatching the encapsulated bundles as if they had been received from
neighboring nodes in the normal course of operations; BIBE PDUs for which
custodial acknowledgment was requested cause the received bundles to be
noted in custody signals that are being aggregated by the receiving node.

B<bibeclo> additionally sends aggregated custody signals in BP administrative
records of (non-standard) record type 8 (BP_BIBE_SIGNAL) as the deadlines
for custody signal transmission arrive.

Note that the reception and processing of both encapsulated bundles and
custody signals is performed by the scheme-specific administration endpoint
daemon(s) at the receiving nodes.  Reception of a custody signal terminates
the custodial re-forwarding timers for all bundles acknowledged in that signal;
the re-forwarding of bundles upon custodial re-forwarding timer expiration is
initiated by the B<bpclock> daemon.

B<bibeclo> is spawned automatically by B<bpadmin> in response to the 's'
(START) command that starts operation of the Bundle Protocol, and it is
terminated by B<bpadmin> in response to an 'x' (STOP) command.  B<bibeclo>
can also be spawned and terminated in response to START and STOP commands
that pertain specifically to the BIBE convergence layer protocol.

=head1 EXIT STATUS

=over 4

=item "0"

B<bibeclo> terminated normally, for reasons noted in the B<ion.log> file.  If
this termination was not commanded, investigate and solve the problem identified
in the log file and use B<bpadmin> to restart B<bibeclo>.

=item "1"

B<bibeclo> terminated abnormally, for reasons noted in the B<ion.log> file.
Investigate and solve the problem identified in the log file, then use
B<bpadmin> to restart B<bibeclo>.

=back

=head1 FILES

No configuration files are needed.

=head1 ENVIRONMENT

No environment variables apply.

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

The following diagnostics may be issued to the B<ion.log> log file:

=over 4

=item bibeclo can't attach to BP.

B<bpadmin> has not yet initialized Bundle Protocol operations.

=item No such bibe outduct.

No BIBE outduct with duct name I<peer_EID> exists.  Use B<bpadmin>
to stop the BIBE convergence-layer protocol, add the outduct, and then
restart the BIBE protocol.

=item No such bcla.

No bcla structure for the node identified by I<peer_EID> has been added to
the BP database.  Use B<bpadmin> to stop the BIBE convergence-layer protocol,
use B<bibeadmin> to add the bcla, and then use B<bpadmin> to restart the
BIBE protocol.

=item CLO task is already started for this duct.

Redundant initiation of B<bibeclo>.

=item Can't dequeue bundle.

BIBE outduct closed deleted or other system error.  Check ION log; correct
the problem and restart BIBE.

=item [i] bibeclo outduct closed.

Nominal shutdown message.

=item Can't prepend header; CLO stopping.

System error.  Check ION log; correct the problem and restart BIBE.

=item Can't destroy old ZCO; CLO stopping.

System error.  Check ION log; correct the problem and restart BIBE.

=item Can't get outbound space for BPDU.

System error.  Check ION log; correct the problem and restart BIBE.

=item Can't send encapsulated bundle.

System error.  Check ION log; correct the problem and restart BIBE.

=item Can't track bundle.

System error.  Check ION log; correct the problem and restart BIBE.

=item [!] Encapsulated bundle not sent.

Malformed bundle issuance request, which might be a software error.  Contact
technical support.

=item Can't release ZCO; CLO stopping.

System error.  Check ION log; correct the problem and restart BIBE.

=item [i] bibeclo duct has ended.

Nominal shutdown message.
