 **
 ** Description: This file provides all structures, variables, and function
 **              definitions necessary for operations associated with the
 **              Abstract Security Block (ASB) structure defined by the
 **              BPSec security extensions.
 **
 **              ASBs are logical structures holding security information for
 **              BIB and BCB security blocks. As such, ABSs must be deserialized
 **              from encoded blocks when processing inbound bundles and
 **              serialized into outbound blocks when transmitting
 **              bundles.
 **
 **              All inbound bpsec blocks are extracted from bundles created
 **              "remotely" (though possibly by the local node via BP loopback)
 **              and received locally. All bpsec blocks created locally are
 **              outbound bpsec blocks.  However, not all outbound bpsec blocks
 **              are created locally.  A bpsec block that was created remotely
 **              and acquired locally may need to be copied to an outbound bpsec
 **              block so that it may be forwarded to other nodes, just as locally
 **              created bpsec blocks must be.
 **
 **              For this purpose, ASB serialization is not needed, since the
 **              serialized form of the block is already present in the "bytes"
 **              array of the inbound block.  All that's needed is to copy the
 **              inbound block's "bytes" array to the SDR heap and store the
 **              address of the copy in the outbound block's "bytes" array.  The
 **              inbound block's ASB (scratchpad object) need not be referenced or
 **              re-serialized.  (Note that an inbound bpsec block must not be
 **              modified in any way before it is forwarded, as this would
 **              invalidate the block's sourceEID.)
 **
 **
 ** Assumptions:
 **      1. We assume that this code is not under such tight profiling
 **         constraints that sanity checks are too expensive.
