=head1 NAME

file2dgr - DGR transmission test program

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<file2dgr> I<remoteHostName> I<fileName> [I<nbrOfCycles>]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<file2dgr> uses DGR to send I<nbrOfCycles> copies of the text of the file
named I<fileName> to the B<dgr2file> process running on the computer identified
by I<remoteHostName>.  If not specified (or if less than 1), I<nbrOfCycles>
defaults to 1.  After sending all lines of the file, B<file2dgr> sends a
datagram containing an EOF string (the ASCII text "*** End of the file ***")
before reopening the file and starting transmission of the next copy.

When all copies of the file have been sent, B<file2dgr> prints a performance
report:

	Bytes sent = I<byteCount>, usec elapsed = I<elapsedTime>.

	Sending I<dataRate> bits per second.
