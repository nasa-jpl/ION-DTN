echo "PURPOSE: Testing the functionality of issue 311: Bundle Streaming Service.
Tests BSS protocol and BSS API:

Bundle Streaming Service, is an architecture specifically developed to
support real-time streaming of multimedia content in DTN environments.
BSS architecture comprises two parts: (a) the Bundle Streaming Service
Protocol (BSSP) which is responsible for forwarding BSS traffic in a
specialized manner and (b) the BSS API which provides developer-friendly  
control over the stream reception procedures by implementing functions 
that are able to create BSS customized databases, control BSS receiving
operations and perform several stream parsing tasks.

	a.  Creation of a customized BSS database, to store the received 
	    frames, by using BSS API functions.
	    
	b.  Under normal operation (real-time mode), BSSP forwards data 
	    through an unreliable link service protocol. In case of frame
	    losses, BSS reforwards the frames for which it didn't receive
	    an acknowledgement through a reliable link service protocol.

	c.  Proper operation of stream parsing functions.

This test simulates the streaming of a HD video by sending a stream of
1000 bundles from node 1 to node 2. The communication channel between
node 1 and node 2 suffers from severe packet loss  (10%); the playback
mode of the BSS forwarding mechanism is activated in order for these
losses to be recovered. At the receiver's end, the frames that arrive
in-order are counted while the out-of-order frames are stored in the
BSS database.  Every 5 seconds the receiver checks to see if all 1000
frames have been received into the database in correct transmission
order; when this has been accomplished, the total numbers of frames
received in real time and in replay are printed and the test terminates.

BSSP provides it's own retransmission, therefore ACS is not activated."
