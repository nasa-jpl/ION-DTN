This test relies upon the implementation of an argument format which has no bpv6 support, and the functionality of being able to address reports returning from your probe bundles to return to an endpoint the bptrace application lisens on locally. The bpv6 implementation of bptrace has support for neither at present. Implementing these features for bpv6 would also incur the cost of implementing custody transfer support including the additional flags and complexity which come with that functionality.
