/*	The IonDB lists of IonContacts and IonRanges are time-ordered,
 *	encyclopedic, and non-volatile.  With the passage of time their
 *	contents are propagated into the IonVdb lists of IonNodes and
 *	IonNeighbors.
 *
 *	Additionally, IonContacts for which either the fromNode or the
 *	toNode is the local node's own node number are used in
 *	congestion forecasting, by computation of maximum scheduled
 *	bundle space occupancy.	
 *
 *	Six different types of contact may be intermixed within a
 *	contact plan.
 *
 *	(1)  A "registration" contact constitutes the registration
 *	of the indicated node (noted as both From and To) in the
 *	region corresponding to the contact plan of which this
 *	contact is a part.  A registration contact simply affirms
 *	the source node's permanent membership in this region,
 *	persisting even during periods when no other contact in
 *	the contact plan cites that node.  The start and stop
 *	times of a registration contact are both set to the
 *	maximum POSIX time, data rate is always zero, confidence
 *	is 1.0.  Registration contacts are always posted via
 *	ionadmin or equivalent.
 *
 *	(2)  A "scheduled" contact is an asserted opportunity to
 *	transmit data between nodes, as inferred (for example)
 *	from a spacecraft or ground station operating plan.  The
 *	confidence value of a scheduled contact is normally 1.0
 *	but may be less if there is uncertainty in the inferred
 *	opportunity.  Scheduled contacts must never overlap in
 *	time.  They are always posted via ionadmin or equivalent.
 *
 *	(3)  A "suppressed" contact is a scheduled contact
 *	BETWEEN THE LOCAL NODE AND SOME NEIGHBORING NODE for
 *	which there is now a discovered contact.  All scheduled
 *	contacts with the indicated neighbor are automatically
 *	suppressed by the ipnd neighbor discovery daemon (or
 *	equivalent), which simply changes the contact type of
 *	each such contact.  So long as a scheduled contact
 *	remains suppressed, its asserted data rates between
 *	the local node and the indicated neighbor node are
 *	operationally ignored.  But suppression of a contact
 *	has no effect on the contact's inclusion in computed
 *	routes nor on the possible selection of such routes
 *	for the forwarding of data.  New suppressed contacts
 *	are never posted in any way.
 *
 *	(4)  A "predicted" contact is a statistically likely
 *	transmission opportunity BETWEEN ANY TWO NODES OTHER
 *	THAN THE LOCAL NODE as inferred from the network's
 *	history of contact discoveries.  Predicted contacts
 *	are used ONLY in route computation.  The confidence
 *	value of a predicted contact is always less than 1.0.
 *	The data rate and confidence of a predicted contact
 *	are computed as a function of the contact history
 *	between the two nodes.  The (sole) predicted contact
 *	for a given pair of nodes is automatically re-computed
 *	by ipnd, in the course of neighbor discovery, whenever
 *	one or more new contact history records for that pair
 *	of nodes are received; new predicted contacts are never
 *	posted in any other way.  
 *
 *	(5)  A "hypothetical" contact is an opportunity to
 *	transmit data BETWEEN THE LOCAL NODE AND SOME OTHER
 *	(POTENTIAL NEIGHBOR) NODE whose occurrence is thought
 *	to be possible at some time in the future, under
 *	unknown conditions.  If the indicated communication
 *	opportunity subsequently does occur, the hypothetical
 *	contact is automatically transformed into a discovered
 *	contact as discussed below and all scheduled contacts
 *	between this pair of nodes are automatically transformed
 *	into suppressed contacts as discussed above.  The start
 *	time of a hypothetical contact is zero, the stop time
 *	is the maximum POSIX time, and the data rate and
 *	confidence are both zero.  Hypothetical contacts are
 *	included in the computation of routes to destination
 *	nodes, but a route that commences with a hypothetical
 *	(rather than discovered) contact cannot be selected
 *	for the forwarding of data, as its confidence value
 *	is zero.  Such contacts essentially provide a mechanism
 *	by which node managers can instruct the bundle protocol
 *	agent to place some currently non-routable bundles into
 *	Limbo that would otherwise simply be abandoned.
 *	Hypothetical contacts are always posted either
 *	automatically by ipnd or equivalent, as discussed
 *	below, or via ionadmin or equivalent.
 *
 *	(6)  A "discovered" contact is an opportunity to transmit
 *	data BETWEEN THE LOCAL NODE AND SOME OTHER NODE (THAT
 *	IS NOW KNOWN TO BE A NEIGHBOR) that has spontaneously
 *	occurred in real time.  Discovery of a contact is
 *	asserted by the ipnd neighbor discovery daemon (or
 *	equivalent), which simply causes the corresponding
 *	hypothetical contact (which is automatically created
 *	if not pre-existing) to be updated with confidence
 *	set to 1.0 and data rate set to the discovered data rate
 *	and (as noted above) temporarily suppresses all data
 *	rate changes asserted by all scheduled contacts for the
 *	same From and To nodes.  When the discovered contact ends,
 *	any suppressed scheduled contacts are restored to efficacy
 *	(i.e., their types are changed back to Scheduled) and the
 *	discovered contact reverts: its contact type is changed
 *	back to Hypoothencial and its data rate and confidence
 *	are reset to zero.  New discovered contacts are never
 *	posted in any other way.					*/

/*	The IonVdb red-black tree of IonNodes, in volatile memory,

 *
 *	The IonVdb also contains red-black trees that (a) index all

 *	a "probe", to determine whether or not the neighbor is still
