# The AMS Protocol

## Purpose and Scope

> The Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems\' (CCSDS)
> Asynchronous Message Service (AMS) is a communication architecture for
> data systems. It is designed to allow mission system modules to
> operate as if they were isolated, each producing and consuming mission
> information without explicit knowledge of the other active modules.
> This self-configuring communication relationship minimizes complexity
> in the development and operation of modular data systems.
>
> AMS is the foundation of a system that can be described as a
> \'society\' of largely autonomous, interoperating modules. These
> modules can adapt over time in response to changing mission
> objectives, functional upgrades of modules, and recovery from
> individual module failures. The primary objective of AMS is to reduce
> mission cost and risk by providing a standard, reusable infrastructure
> for information exchange among data system modules. This
> infrastructure is designed to be user-friendly, highly automated,
> flexible, robust, scalable, and efficient.
>
> Notably, AMS provides a publication and subscription service for both
> terrestrial and extraterrestrial communications, utilizing the
> Interplanetary Overlay Network (ION). This service ensures a seamless
> and efficient communication system that can adapt dynamically to
> various missions.

## Definitions

> Within the context of this document the following definitions apply:
>
> A *continuum* is a closed set of entities that utilize AMS for
> purposes of communication among themselves. Each continuum is
> identified by a *continuum name* and corresponding non-negative
> continuum number. The continuum name that is the character string of
> length zero indicates "all known continua" or "any known continuum",
> whichever is less restrictive in the context in which this continuum
> name is used; the reserved continuum number zero corresponds to this
> continuum name.
>
> An *application* is a data system implementation, typically taking the
> form of a set of source code text files, that relies on AMS procedures
> to accomplish its purposes. Each application is identified by an
> *application name*.
>
> An *authority* is an administrative entity or persona that may have
> responsibility for the configuration and operation of an application.
> Each authority is identified by an *authority name*.
>
> A *venture* is an instance of an application, i.e., a functioning
> projection of the application -- for which some authority is
> responsible -- onto a set of one or more running computers.
>
> A *message* is an octet array of known size which, when copied from
> the memory of one module of a venture to that of another
> (*exchanged*), conveys information that can further the purposes of
> that venture.
>
> The *content* of a message is the array of zero or more octets
> embedded in the message containing the specific information that the
> message conveys.
>
> A *role* is some part of the functionality of an application. Each
> role is identified by a *role name* and corresponding non-negative
> role number. The role name that is the character string of length zero
> indicates 'all roles' or 'any role', whichever is less restrictive in
> the context in which the role name is used; the reserved role number
> zero corresponds to this role name. The role name "RAMS \'\'
> identifies Remote AMS (RAMS) gateway functionality as discussed below;
> the reserved role number 1 corresponds to this role name.
>
> A *module* (of some mission data system) is a communicating entity
> that implements some part of the functionality of some AMS venture --
> that is, performs some application role -- by, among other activities,
> exchanging messages with other modules. Associated with each module is
> the name of the role it performs within the application. \[Note that
> multiple modules may perform the same role in an application, so the
> role name of a module need not uniquely identify the module within its
> message space.\] In order to accomplish AMS message exchange a module
> generates AMS service requests and consumes AMS service indications;
> the module that is the origin of a given AMS service request or the
> destination of a given AMS service indication is termed *the operative
> module*.
>
> A *message space* is the set of all of the modules of one AMS venture
> that are members of a single AMS continuum; that is, a message space
> is the intersection of a venture and a continuum. Each message space
> is uniquely identified within that continuum by the combination of the
> name of the application and the name of the authority that is
> responsible for the venture, and by a corresponding venture number
> greater than zero. \[Note that unique naming of continua enables
> multiple message spaces that are in different continua but are
> identified by the same application and authority names to be
> concatenated via Remote AMS (discussed below) into a single venture.\]
>
> A *unit* (i.e., a unit of organization) is an identified subset of the
> organizational hierarchy of the modules of one AMS venture, declared
> during venture configuration as specified by the responsible authority
> for that venture. Each unit is uniquely identified within the venture
> by *unit name* and corresponding non-negative unit number. The *root
> unit* of a venture is the unit that is coterminous with the venture
> itself; its unit name is the character string that is of length zero,
> and the reserved unit number zero corresponds to this unit name. A
> unit whose name is identical to the first N bytes -- where N is
> greater than or equal to zero -- of the name of another unit of the
> same message space is said to *contain* that other unit. The
> membership of a unit that is contained by another unit is a subset of
> the membership of the containing unit.

A *cell* is the set of all modules that are members of one unit of a
given venture and are also members of a given continuum; that is, it is
the intersection of a unit and a continuum. Since each unit is a subset
of a venture, each cell is necessarily a subset of the message space for
that venture in that continuum. Each cell is uniquely identified within
its message space by its unit's name and number. The root cell of a
message space is coterminous with the message space itself. A cell
contains some other cell only if its unit contains that other cell's
unit. A cell may be an empty set; that is, in a given continuum there
may be no modules that are members of the cell's unit. The *registered
membership* of a cell is the set of all modules in the cell that are not
members of any other cell which does not contain that cell^1^. \[Note
that the root cell contains every other cell in the message space, and
every module in the message space is therefore a member -- though not
necessarily a registered member -- of the root cell.\]

> The *domain* of an AMS service request is the set of modules to which
> the request pertains. It comprises all of the modules that are members
> of the venture in which the operative module is itself a member, with
> the following exceptions:

- If the service request is one for which continuum ID is not
  specified, then only modules that are members of the local continuum
  are members of the service request's domain. Otherwise, if the
  service request's continuum ID parameter does not indicate "all
  continua", then only modules that are members of the continuum
  identified by the service request's continuum ID parameter are
  members of the service request's domain.
- Only modules that are members of the organizational unit identified
  by the service request's unit ID parameter are members of the
  service request's domain.
- If the service request's role ID parameter does not indicate "all
  roles", then only modules performing the role identified by that
  role ID are members of the service request's domain.

> The *subject number* (or *subject*) of a message is an integer
> embedded in the message that indicates the general nature of the
> information the message conveys, in the context of the AMS venture
> within which the message is exchanged. A *subject name* is a text
> string that serves as the symbolic representation of some subject
> number.
>
> To *send* a message is to cause it to be copied to the memory of a
> specified module. To *publish* a message on a specified subject is to
> cause it to be sent to one or more implicitly specified modules,
> namely, all those that have requested copies of all messages on the
> specified subject. To *announce* a message is to cause it to be sent
> to one or more implicitly specified modules, namely, all those modules
> that are located within a specified continuum (or all continua), are
> members of a specified unit (possibly the root unit) and that perform
> a specified role in the application (possibly "any role").
>
> A *subscription* is a statement requesting that one copy of every
> message published on some specified subject by any module in the
> subscription's *domain* be sent to the subscribing module; the domain
> of a subscription is the domain of the AMS service request that
> established the subscription.
>
> ^1^ For example, if cell A contains cells B and C, and cell C contains
> cells D and E, any nodes in C that are not in either D or E are in the
> registered membership of cell C. Those nodes are also members of cell
> A, but because they are in cell C -- which does not contain cell A --
> they are not in cell A's registered membership.
>
> An *invitation* is a statement of the manner in which messages on some
> specified subject may be sent to the inviting module by modules in the
> *domain* of the invitation; the invitation's domain is the domain of
> the AMS service request that established the invitation.

## Overview

### General

1. **Architectural Character**

> A data system based on AMS has the following characteristics:

a.  Any module may be introduced into the system at any time. That is,
    the order in which system modules commence operation is immaterial;
    a module never needs to establish an explicit *a priori*
    communication "connection" or "channel" to any other module in order
    to pass messages to it or receive messages from it.

b.  Any module may be removed from the system at any time without
    inhibiting the ability of any other module to continue sending and
    receiving messages. That is, the termination of any module, whether
    planned or unplanned, only causes the termination of other modules
    that have been specifically designed to terminate in this event.

c.  When a module must be upgraded to an improved version, it may be
    terminated and its replacement may be started at any time; there is
    no need to interrupt operations of the system as a whole.

d.  When the system as a whole must terminate, the order in which the
    system's modules cease operation is immaterial.

> AMS-based systems are highly robust, lacking any innate single point
> of failure and tolerant of unplanned module termination. At the same
> time, communication within an AMS-based system can be rapid and
> efficient:

e.  Messages are exchanged directly between modules rather than through
    any central message dispatching nexus.

f.  Messages are automatically conveyed using the "best" (typically --
    though not necessarily -- the fastest) underlying transport service
    to which the sending and receiving modules both have access. For
    example, messages between two ground system modules running in
    different computers on a common LAN would likely be conveyed via
    TCP/IP, while messages between modules running on two flight
    processors connected to a common bus memory board might be conveyed
    via a shared-memory message queue.

g.  Finally, AMS is designed to be highly scalable: partitioning message
    spaces into units enables a venture to comprise hundreds or
    thousands of cooperating modules without significant impact on
    application performance.

2. **Message Exchange Models**

> AMS message exchange is fundamentally asynchronous, akin to a
> \"postal\" system. An AMS module, after sending a message, can
> continue its functions without waiting for a reply.
>
> While message exchange is asynchronous, AMS provides a mechanism for
> linking reply messages to their original context. This is achieved by
> including a context number in the original message. The reply message
> automatically echoes this context number, allowing the original sender
> to link the reply to the application activity that triggered the
> initial message. This creates a pseudo-synchronous communication flow.
> The specific mechanism for establishing this link is
> implementation-dependent.
>
> In some cases, true message synchrony may be necessary, requiring a
> module to suspend operations until a reply is received. AMS supports
> this communication model when required.
>
> The majority of message exchange in an AMS-based system follows a
> \"publish-subscribe\" model. A module announces its subscription to a
> specific subject using AMS procedures. From that point, any published
> message on that subject is automatically delivered to all subscribing
> modules. This model simplifies application development and
> integration, allowing each module to plug into a data \"grid\" and
> exchange data without detailed knowledge of other modules.
>
> However, there may be instances where a module needs to send a message
> privately to a specific module, such as in reply to a published
> message. AMS also supports this communication model when necessary.

4. **Communicating Entities**

> All AMS communication is conducted among three types of communicating
> entities: modules (defined earlier), registrars, and configuration
> servers.
>
> A *registrar* is a communicating entity that catalogs information
> regarding the registered membership of a single unit of a message
> space. It responds to queries for this information, and it updates
> this information as changes are announced.
>
> A *configuration server* is a communicating entity that catalogs
> information regarding the message spaces established within some AMS
> continuum, specifically the locations of the registrars of all units
> of all message spaces. It responds to queries for this information,
> and it updates this information as changes are announced.

### Overview of Interactions

5. **Transport Services for Application Messages**

> AMS, best characterized as a messaging \"middleware\" protocol,
> operates between the Transport and Application layers of the OSI
> protocol stack model. It relies on underlying Transport-layer
> protocols for actual message copying from sender to receiver and for
> transmitting meta-AMS (or MAMS) messages for dynamic
> self-configuration of AMS message spaces.
>
> In any AMS continuum, a common transport service, termed the Primary
> Transport Service (PTS), is used for MAMS traffic by all entities
> involved in the operations of all message spaces. The PTS, being
> universally available, can also be used for application message
> exchange among all modules in a continuum. However, in some cases,
> performance can be improved by using Supplementary Transport Services
> (STSs), especially when modules share access to a convenient
> communication medium like a shared-memory message queue.
>
> Supplementary Transport Services (STSs) are performance-optimizing
> transport services used in the Asynchronous Message Service (AMS) for
> message exchange between modules that share access to a particularly
> convenient communication medium, such as a shared-memory message
> queue. While the Primary Transport Service (PTS) is universally
> available for message exchange, STSs can be employed to enhance
> application performance in certain scenarios (see CCSDS Blue Book
> Recommended Standard 735.1-B-1 \"Asynchronous Message Service\" for
> additional information).
>
> A module\'s network location for receiving messages via a given
> transport service is its delivery point for that service. A module may
> have multiple delivery points, each characterized by the same service
> mode. For a given service mode, the list of all delivery points
> providing that mode to a module, ranked in descending order of
> preference (typically network performance), is termed the delivery
> vector for that service mode, for that module.
>
> See "Primary Transport Services" below for additional information.

6. **Registrar Registration**

> Every message space in AMS always includes at least one unit, the root
> unit, and each module is registered within a unit. In the simplest
> case, all modules reside in the root unit. Each unit is served by a
> single registrar, which monitors the health of all registered modules
> and propagates six types of message space configuration changes.
>
> Registrars themselves register with the configuration server for the
> continuum containing the message space. A list of all potential
> network locations for the configuration server, ranked in descending
> order of preference, must be well-known and included in the AMS
> management information bases (MIBs) accessible to all registrars. Each
> continuum must always have an operational configuration server at one
> of these locations to enable registration of registrars and modules.
>
> All registrars and modules of the same message space must register
> through the same configuration server.

7. **Module Registration**

> Each module has a single meta-AMS delivery point (MAPD) for receiving
> MAMS messages. A new module joins a message space by registering
> within a unit, announcing its role name and MAPD to the unit\'s
> registrar. However, the module cannot have hard-coded information
> about the registrar\'s communication details, as these can change.
>
> Therefore, the first step in registering a new module is contacting
> the configuration server at one of its known network locations. These
> locations, listed in descending order of preference, are included in
> the AMS Management Information Bases (MIBs) accessible to all
> application modules. The configuration server then provides the new
> module with the contact details for its registrar.
>
> The module obtains a unique module number from the registrar and
> completes registration. The registrar ensures that all other modules
> in the message space learn the new module\'s role name, module number,
> and MAPD. These modules, in turn, announce their own details to the
> new module.

8. **Monitoring Module Health**

> Maintaining accurate knowledge of a message space configuration is
> crucial for application purposes and resource efficiency. Each
> registrar must promptly detect the termination of modules in its
> unit\'s registered membership. While a module under application
> control notifies its registrar upon termination, a module that crashes
> or is powered off does not. To address this, each module sends a
> \"heartbeat\" message to its registrar every few seconds (see comment
> #3 at top of amscommon.h for additional details). The registrar
> interprets three consecutive missing heartbeats as a module
> termination.
>
> Upon detecting a module\'s termination, either overt or imputed from
> heartbeat failure, the registrar informs all other modules in the
> unit\'s registered membership and, through other registrars, all
> modules in the message space.
>
> When termination is imputed from a heartbeat failure, the registrar
> attempts to notify the presumed terminated module. If the module is
> still running, it terminates immediately upon receiving this message,
> minimizing system confusion due to other application behavior
> triggered by the imputed termination.

9. **Monitoring Registrar Health**

> Each registrar not only monitors the heartbeats of all modules in its
> unit\'s registered membership but also issues its own heartbeats to
> those modules. If a module detects three consecutive missing registrar
> heartbeats, it assumes the registrar has crashed. The module then
> re-queries the configuration server to determine the new network
> location of the registrar and resumes exchanging heartbeats.
>
> This assumption is reasonable because the configuration server also
> monitors registrar heartbeats on a slightly shorter cycle. If the
> configuration server detects three consecutive missing registrar
> heartbeats, it takes action to restart the registrar, possibly on a
> different host. Therefore, by the time the registrar\'s modules detect
> its crash, it should already be running again.
>
> Since the module heartbeat interval is two seconds (see N4 in
> amscommon.h), the registrar will receive heartbeat messages from every
> running module in the unit\'s registered membership within the first
> six seconds after restart. This allows the registrar to accurately
> know the unit\'s configuration. This accurate configuration
> information must be delivered to new modules at startup, enabling them
> to orient a newly-restarted registrar if it crashes. Therefore, during
> the first six seconds after the registrar starts, it only accepts MAMS
> messages from modules already registered in the unit. This prevents
> the risk of delivering incorrect information to a new module.

10. **Configuration Service Fail-over**

> A configuration server, like any other component, can also fail or be
> rebooted. Each registrar interprets three consecutive missing
> configuration server heartbeats as an indication of a crash. Upon
> detecting such a crash, the registrar cycles through all the known
> network locations for the continuum's configuration server, attempting
> to re-establish communication after the server's restart, possibly at
> an alternate network location. New modules attempting to register will
> also cycle through network locations seeking a restarted configuration
> server and will be unable to contact their registrars, and therefore
> unable to register, until they find one. However, application message
> exchange and subscription management activity among existing modules
> and registrars are not affected by this infrastructure failure.
>
> Upon the configuration server\'s restart at one of its known network
> locations, all registrars will eventually find it and re-announce
> themselves, enabling newly registering application modules to
> successfully register.
>
> In certain failure scenarios, multiple configuration servers may
> operate concurrently for a brief period, such as when a perceived
> failure is caused by a transient network connectivity issue rather
> than an actual server crash. To resolve this, each running
> configuration server periodically sends an "I am running" MAMS message
> to every lower-ranking configuration server network location in the
> known list of configuration server locations. If a configuration
> server receives such a message, it immediately terminates. All
> registrars and modules communicating with it will detect its
> disappearance and search again for the highest-ranking reachable
> configuration server, eventually restoring orderly operations in the
> continuum.

11. **Configuration Resync**

> Finally, every registrar can optionally be configured to re-advertise
> to the entire message space the detailed configuration of its unit's
> registered membership (all active modules, all subscriptions and
> invitations) at some user-specified frequency, e.g., once per minute.
> This capability is referred to as *configuration resync*.
> Configuration resync of course generates additional message traffic,
> and it may be unnecessary in extremely simple or extremely stable
> operating environments. But it does ensure that every change in
> application message space configuration will eventually be propagated
> to every module in the message space, even if some MAMS messages are
> lost and even if an arbitrary number of registrars had crashed at the
> time the change occurred.
>
> Taken together, these measures make AMS applications relatively fault
> tolerant:

a.  When a module crashes, its registrar detects the loss of heartbeat
    within three heartbeat intervals and notifies the rest of the
    message space. Application message transmission everywhere is
    unaffected.When a registrar crashes, its configuration server
    detects the loss of heartbeat within three heartbeat intervals and
    takes action to restart the registrar. During the time that the unit
    has no registrar, transmission of application messages among modules
    of the message space is unaffected, but the heartbeat failures of
    crashed modules are not detected and reconfiguration messages
    originating in the unit's registered membership (registrations,
    terminations, subscription and invitation assertions, and
    subscription and invitation cancellations) are not propagated to any
    modules. However, after the registrar is restarted it will
    eventually detect the losses of heartbeat from all crashed modules
    and will issue obituaries to the message space, and if configuration
    resync is enabled it will eventually re- propagate the lost
    reconfiguration messages.

b.  When a configuration server crashes, all new registration activity
    will come to a standstill. But no application modules fail (at
    least, not because of communication failure), and on restart of the
    configuration server the registration of new modules eventually
    resumes.

12. **Security**

> AMS can be configured to confine service access to application modules
> that can prove they are authorized to participate. For this purpose,
> asymmetric MAMS encryption may be used as follows:

a.  The AMS MIB exposed to the configuration server contains a list of
    all applications for which registration service may be offered,
    identified by application name. Associated with each application
    name is the AMS public encryption key for that application.

b.  The AMS MIB exposed to every registrar in each message space
    contains a list of all functional role names defined for the message
    space's application; this list limits the role names under which
    modules may register in that message space. Associated with each
    role name is the AMS public encryption key for the application
    module(s) that may register in that role.

c.  The AMS MIBs exposed to all registrars and application modules in
    the message space contain the AMS public encryption key of the
    configuration server.

d.  The AMS MIBs exposed to the configuration server and to all
    registrars and application modules in the message space contain the
    private encryption keys that are relevant to those entities.

> As described later, this information is used to authenticate registrar
> registration and exclude spurious registrars from the message space,
> to authenticate module registration attempts and deny registration to
> unauthorized application modules, and to assure the authenticity,
> confidentiality, and integrity of MAMS traffic exchanged between
> modules and their registrars.
>
> In addition, the confidentiality and integrity of AMS message exchange
> may be protected at subject granularity. The AMS MIB exposed to each
> module of a given message space may contain, for any subset of the
> message subjects (identified by name and number) used in the message
> space's application:

e.  a list of the role names of all modules that are authorized senders
    of messages on this subject;

f.  a list of the role names of all modules that are authorized
    receivers of messages on this subject;

g.  encryption parameters, including a symmetric encryption key,
    enabling encryption of messages on this subject.

> This information may be used to support secure transmission of
> messages on selected subjects.
>
> ***Note**, though, that the JPL implementation of AMS **does not
> implement** any of the cryptographic algorithms that are required to
> support these security features.*

13. **Subject Catalog**

> The structure of the content of messages on a given subject is
> application-specific; message content structure is not defined by the
> AMS protocol. However, the AMS MIB exposed to all modules of a given
> message space will contain, for each message subject (identified by
> name and number) used in the message space:

a.  a description of this message subject, discussing the semantics of
    this type of message;

b.  a detailed specification of the structure of the content of messages
    on this subject;

c.  optionally, a specification of the manner in which a correctly
    assembled message is marshaled for network transmission in a
    platform-neutral manner and, on reception, un-marshaled into a
    format that is suitable for processing by the application.

> When AMS is requested to send a message on a given subject, the
> message content that is presented for transmission is always in a
> format that is suitable for processing by the application. In the
> event that this format is not suitable for network transmission in a
> platform-neutral manner, as indicated by the presence in the MIB of a
> marshaling specification for this subject, AMS will marshal the
> message content as required before transmitting the message.
>
> When AMS receives a message on a subject for which a marshaling
> specification is present in the MIB, AMS will un-marshal the message
> content into a format that is suitable for processing by the
> application before delivering the message.
>
> Message subjects, as noted earlier, are integers with
> application-defined semantics. This minimizes the cost of including
> subject information (in effect, message type) in every message, and it
> makes processing simpler and faster: subscription and invitation
> information are recorded in arrays that are indexed by subject number.
>
> This implementation choice, however, requires that message management
> control arrays be large enough to accommodate the largest subject
> numbers used in the application. The use of extremely large subject
> numbers would therefore cause these arrays to consume significant
> amounts of memory. In general, it is best for an AMS application to
> use the **smallest** subject numbers possible, starting with 1.

14. **Remote AMS Message Exchange**

> AMS' asynchronous message issuance model allows for a high degree of
> concurrency in the operations of data system modules. This means that
> a module can issue a message without suspending its operation until a
> response is received. This feature also largely insulates applications
> from variations in signal propagation time across the AMS continuum.
>
> However, some critical MAMS (Multicast AMS) communication is
> unavoidably synchronous. For instance, a newly registering module must
> wait for responses from the configuration server and the registrar
> before it can proceed with application activity. Therefore, the core
> AMS protocol is best suited for operational contexts with generally
> uninterrupted network connectivity and relatively small and
> predictable signal propagation times, such as the Internet or a
> stand-alone local area network. It is typically advantageous for all
> entities within a single AMS continuum to operate within such a
> \"low-latency\" environment
>
> AMS application messages can be exchanged between modules in different
> AMS continua using the Remote AMS (RAMS) procedures. These procedures
> are executed by special-purpose application modules known as RAMS
> gateways. Each RAMS gateway interfaces with two communication
> environments: the AMS message space it serves and the RAMS network,
> which is a mesh or tree of mutually aware RAMS gateways. This network
> enables AMS messages produced in one message space to be forwarded to
> other message spaces within the same venture.. RAMS gateways operate
> as follows:

a.  RAMS gateways operate by opening private RAMS network communication
    channels to the RAMS gateways of other message spaces within the
    same venture. These interconnected gateways use these communication
    channels to forward message petition assertions and cancellations
    among themselves.

b.  Each RAMS gateway subscribes locally to all subjects that are of
    interest in any of the linked message spaces.

c.  When a RAMS gateway receives a message on any of these subjects, it
    uses the RAMS network to forward the message to every other linked
    RAMS gateway whose message space contains at least one module that
    has subscribed to messages on that subject.

d.  On receiving a message the RAMS gateway module forwards the message
    to any subscribers in its own message space.

> The RAMS protocol allows for the free flow of published application
> messages across deep space links while ensuring efficient utilization
> of those links. Only a single copy of any message is ever transmitted
> on any RAMS grid communication channel, regardless of how many
> subscribers will receive copies when the message reaches its
> destination.

# The JPL Implementation

> JPL's implementation of AMS has the following components:

- a daemon process (**amsd**) which can function as a configuration
  server, a registrar for a single message space, or both, depending
  on command-line parameters used when starting the process.
- A library (**libams**) that implements the AMS application
  programming interface. This library is typically provided as a
  "shared object" that is dynamically linked with application code at
  run time.
- An implementation of Remote AMS (RAMS) comprising a library
  (**librams**).

> The codebase, written in C, relies on a shared library, ICI. This
> library supports other JPL implementations, like CFDP and the DTN
> Bundle Protocol. ICI includes a \"platform\" portability layer, easing
> code compilation and execution in environments like Linux, vxWorks,
> and Interix.
>
> ICI also includes its own dynamic memory management system, called
> "PSM", which provides dynamic management of a privately allocated
> block of memory. This may be useful in environments such as spacecraft
> flight software where the dynamic management of system memory
> (*malloc*, *free*) cannot be tolerated. Use of PSM by AMS is optional.
>
> An AMS application program, linked with **libams**, uses the
> *ams_register* function to instantiate an AMS module registered within
> a specified unit of a specified message space. Once registration is
> accomplished, the application may commence inviting, subscribing to,
> publishing, announcing, sending, and replying to messages.
>
> This AMS implementation is multi-threaded. The process of registration
> starts a pair of POSIX threads, or pthreads, which manage timing and
> MAMS events in the background. Additionally, another pthread is
> started to receive MAMS messages via the primary transport service and
> add them to the MAMS event queue. This queue also includes MAMS
> message transmission requests. For each transport service that the
> module can receive AMS messages from, one more pthread is started.
> These threads receive AMS messages and add them to the AMS event
> queue, combining them with \"discovery\" events added by the MAMS
> event handling thread.
>
> The general structure of an AMS module, then, is as shown in [Figure
> 3](#_heading=h.2s8eyo1) below.

> The application program has the option to start another thread to
> manage AMS events. This thread automatically calls event-type-specific
> callback functions, leaving the main application thread free to
> respond to non-AMS events, such as mouse events or keyboard input. The

> event queue, potentially with higher priority than any queued AMS
> messages. However, to prevent certain types of unusual application
> behavior, the main application thread is not allowed to receive and
> handle any AMS events while the background AMS event handling thread
> is running.

# Primary Transport Services

> As shipped, AMS currently includes support for two underlying
> transport services: TCP, and DGR (Datagram Retransmission, a UDP-based
> system that includes congestion control and retransmission-based
> reliability). Although TCP is faster than DGR, its connection-based
> architecture makes it unsuitable as a primary transport service: all
> MAMS message traffic is conveyed via connectionless DGR.

# Installation

AMS source is provided in the ION distribution (a gzipped tarfile
containing AMS and all supporting ION packages: ici, dgr, ltp, and bp,
etc.).

The following two installation methods are provided.

## Automake

This method automatically compiles and links all required executables,
installs them, and copies ION library headers to the relevant system
path(s) on your system.Use the following command sequence in the unzipped ION source directory
(Linux).

1. ./configure
2. make
3. sudo make install
4. sudo ldconfig

Note: if support for the expat XML parsing library is required see 4.3
"Support for the Expat XML Parsing Library" below

## Make

> This alternate installation method installs all ION packages (if run
> from ION root directory), or installs individual ION packages as
> follows

1. Before installation, first determine which environment (i.e.
   platform) you're going to be building for: i86- redhat,
   i86_64-fedora, sparc-solaris, RTEMS, etc. Note this for the
   following step
2. Move the ION .gz file to a directory in which you want to build the
   system, gunzip the file, and then un-tar it; a number of new
   directories will appear.AMS requires the following packages: ici, dgr, ltp, bp, and ams. For
   each, in that *specific order*, do the following:cd to directory_namemodify Makefile (as needed):\"PLATFORMS = environment_name\"\]modify Makefile (as needed):\"OPT = desired system path\"\]makesudo make installcd ..
3. For additional information see the ION Design and Operations manual
   for dependency details and package build order instructions (see
   ION.pdf in the ION distribution tar)

> Note that for both install methods (e.g. on Linux) the default
> configuration used in the ION makefiles is as follows:

- ION package binaries are installed into /usr/local/bin/
- ION library objects are installed into /usr/local/lib/.
- ION library header files are installed into
  **/**usr/local/include**/**.
- Manual pages are installed into /usr/local/man1, /usr/local/man3,
  and /usr/local/man5

> If you want a different configuration, you'll need to modify the
> makefiles accordingly (e.g. see the OPT variable in 2b above).

## Support for the Expat XML Parsing Library

> The **expat** open-source XML parsing library is required by AMS only
> if MIBs use the XML format (see man amsxml and man amsrc for
> additional information).
>
> Note that Linux environments typically have **expat** built in, but
> for VxWorks installations it is necessary to download and install
> **expat** prior to installing AMS.
>
> To build ION with support for expat use the following flag during the
> .configure step of installation (see 4.1 "Automake" above):
>
> ./configure \--with-expat

# The AMS Daemon

> The AMS daemon program **amsd** can function as the configuration
> server for a continuum, as the registrar for one cell of a specified
> message space, or both. To run it, enter a command of the following
> form at a terminal window prompt:
>
> amsd *mib_source_name eid_spec*
>
> or
>
> amsd *mib_source_name eid_spec application_name authority_name
> unit_name*
>
> The former form of the command starts **amsd** as a configuration
> server only.
>
> *mib_source_name* is as discussed in the documentation of ams_register
> below; it enables **amsd** to run.
>
> *eid_spec* is a string that specifies the IP address and port that
> **amsd** must establish in order to receive MAMS messages in its
> capacity as a configuration server. See *man amsd* for more
> information.
>
> When the latter form of the **amsd** command is used, the daemon is
> configured to function as the registrar for the indicated message
> space unit. If the value "." (period character) is supplied for
> *eid_spec*, then the daemon will [only]{.underline} function as a
> registrar. Otherwise the daemon will function as both configuration
> server and registrar; this option can be useful when operating a
> simple, stand-alone message space, such as a demo.

# "C" Application Programming Interface

> The AMS application programming interface is defined by the header
> file **ams.h**, which must be **#include**d at the beginning of any
> AMS application program source file.
>
> See section 9 'Application Development Guide' for compilation and
> linkage instructions.

## Module Management functions

> int [ams_register]{.underline}(char \*mibSource, char \*tsorder, char

> \*roleName, AmsModule
>
> \*module);
>
> This function is used to initiate the application's participation as a
> module in the message space identified by specified application and
> authority names, within the local AMS continuum.
>
> *mibSource* indicates the location of the Management Information Base
> (MIB) information that will enable the proposed new module to
> participate in its chosen message space. Nominally it is the name of
> an XML file in the current working directory; if NULL, *mibSource*
> defaults to *roleName*.xml. (A future version of loadmib.c might load
> MIB information from an ICI "sdr" database rather than from a file.)
>
> *tsorder* is the applicable overriding transport service selection
> order string. This capability is not yet fully supported; for now,
> *tsorder* should always be NULL.
>
> *applicationName* identifies the AMS application within which the
> proposed new module is designed to function. The application must be
> declared in the MIB.
>
> *authorityName*, together with *applicationName*, identifies the
> message space in which the new module proposes to register. The
> message space must be declared in the MIB.
>
> *unitName* identifies the cell, within the specified message space, in
> which the new module proposes to register. The unit must be declared
> in the MIB for ventures containing the specified message space, and a
> registrar for this cell of this message space must currently be
> running in order for the ams_register function to succeed.
>
> *roleName* identifies the functional role that the proposed new module
> is designed to perform within the indicated application. The role must
> be declared in the MIB for that application, and its name will serve
> as the name of the module.
>
> *module* points to the variable in which the applicable AMS service
> access point will be returned upon successful registration of the new
> module.
>
> The function returns 0 on success, -1 on any error.
>
> The application thread that invoked ams_register is assumed by AMS to
> be the main application thread for the module, or "prime thread".
> Following successful completion of ams_register all threads of the
> application process may commence invoking AMS services -- inviting
> messages, publishing messages, etc. -- except that only the prime
> thread may receive AMS events, e.g., process incoming messages.
>
> int [ams_get_module_nbr]{.underline}(AmsModule module);

>
> int [ams_set_event_mgr]{.underline}(AmsModule module, AmsEventMgt
> \*rules);
>
> The function starts a background "event manager" thread that
> automatically receives and processes all AMS events (messages, notices
> of message space configuration change, etc.) enqueued for the
> indicated module.
>
> The thread processes each event according to the indicated *rules*
> structure; any event for which a NULL callback function is provided is
> simply discarded. For details of the rules structure and prototype
> definitions for the callback functions that the rules point to, see
> [6.1](#type-and-macro-definitions) above. Some notes on this
> interface:

- None of the callback functions return values, so they cannot
  directly terminate the event manager. A callback function can
  indirectly terminate the event manager by signaling the prime thread
  to call ams_remove_event_mgr.
- The event delivered to a callback is recycled automatically when the
  callback returns. If for some reason the application needs to retain
  the event for a while, the callback function can prevent
  therecycling of the event by simply setting *\*eventRef* to NULL; in
  this case the application assumes responsibility for recycling the
  event at some future time in order to avert memory leakage.

> While the event manager thread is running, the prime thread is
> prohibited from receiving any AMS events itself, i.e., ams_get_event
> will always fail.
>
> Only the prime thread may call ams_set_event_mgr. The function returns
> 0 on success, -1 on any error.
>
> void [ams_remove_event_mgr]{.underline}(AmsModule module);
>
> The function stops the background event manager thread for this
> module, if any is running. Only the prime thread may call
> ams_remove_event_mgr. Following completion of this function the prime
> thread is once again able to receive and process AMS events.
>
> int [ams_unregister]{.underline}(AmsModule module);
>
> The function terminates the module's registration, ending the ability
> of any thread of the application process to invoke any AMS services;
> it automatically stops the background event manager thread for this
> module, if any is running.
>
> Only the prime thread may call ams_unregister. The function returns 0
> on success, -1 on any error.

> indicates "all continua".

- The module is registered in a message space that is characterized by
  the same application name and authority name as the invoking
  module's own message space.
- The module is registered, within its message space, in the unit
  identified by *unitNbr* or in a unit that is contained within that
  unit. Again, unit number zero identifies the root unit containing
  all units in the message space.
- The module's role matches *roleNbr*. A value of zero in roleNbr
  indicates "all roles".

> returns control to the invoking function immediately. If *term* is -1,
> the function never returns control until a non-timeout event can be
> acquired.
>
> The function returns 0 on success, -1 on any error. Following
> acquisition of an event, the application program should:

- Call ams_get_event_type to determine the type of the event.
- Call the appropriate event parsing function, based on the type of
  the event, to extract the event's salient information. (Note that
  timeout events contain no additional information and cannot be
  further parsed.)
- Process the information conveyed by the event.
- Call ams_recycle_event to release the memory occupied by the event,
  in order to prevent memory leakage.

# Remote AMS

> The JPL implementation of Remote AMS comprises a library
> (**librams.c**) and a sample RAMS gateway program (**ramsTest.c**)
> that uses that library.

## Library

> The RAMS library implements a very simple API, which is defined by the
> header file
>
> **rams.h** and comprises just a single function:
>
> int [rams_run]{.underline}(char \*mibSource, char \*tsorder, char
> \*applicationName, char \*authorityName, char \*unitName, char
> \*roleName, int lifetime);
>
> This function initiates a RAMS gateway operations loop. *mibSource*,
> *tsorder*, *mName*, *memory*, *mSize*, *applicationName*,
> *authorityName*, *unitName*, and *roleName* are as discussed in the
> documentation of [ams_register]{.underline} above; they are used to
> register the RAMS gateway process as an AMS module. *lifetime* is the
> user-specified maximum time to live for all DTN bundles issued by the
> RAMS gateway in the course of its communications over the RAMS
> network.
>
> Note that the priority assigned to any DTN bundle that conveys a
> published or privately sent AMS message over the RAMS network will be
> computed as a function of the flow label specified at the time the
> message was originally published or sent. If no overriding flow label
> was specified, then the bundle priority will be 1 (standard).
> Otherwise, the number represented by the two low-order bits of the
> flow label will be used as the bundle priority and two "extended class
> of service" parameters will be derived from the next two higher-order
> bits of the flow label: bit 5 (the 3^rd^-lowest-order bit) will be
> used as the value of the "minimum latency" flag, with a value of 1
> indicating that the bundle is critical, and bit 4 (the
> 4^th^-lowest-order bit) will be used as the value of the "best-effort"
> flag, with a value of 1 indicating that the bundle should be sent over
> an unacknowledged convergence-layer protocol. All bundles issued by
> the RAMS gateway that don't carry AMS messages will be assigned bundle
> priority 1.
>
> This function runs indefinitely until it fails or is interrupted by a
> SIGINT signal. Returns -1 on any failure, 0 on normal termination.

## ramsgate

> The sample RAMS gateway program **ramsgate** provides basic RAMS
> gateway functionality. To run it, enter a command of the following
> form at a terminal window prompt:
>
> ramsgate *application_name authority_name_name lifetime*
> \[*memory_size* \[*memory_manager_name*\]\]
>
> *application_name*, *authority_name*, *lifetime*,
> *memory_manager_name*, and *memory_size* are as discussed in the
> documentation of ams_register. If not specified, memory size defaults
> to 200000. The gateway process always registers in the role named
> "RAMS".
>
> Note that **ramsgate** relies on the ION implementation of DTN; be
> sure an ION node is operating on the local computer before starting
> **ramsgate**. (See the ION Design and Operations Guide for details.)
>
> To terminate operation of the gateway process, just use CTRL-C to
> interrupt the program.

# Management Information Base

> In order to operate correctly, every AMS application process -- and
> **amsd** as well -- must initially load Management Information Base
> (MIB) values that are universally consistent.
>
> Currently this is accomplished automatically during registration: MIB
> value declaration commands in XML format are read from a file, parsed,
> and processed automatically.

# Application Development

> AMS applications (i.e. "modules") are custom software built using AMS'
> application programming interface (API). These AMS modules serve as
> the interfaces between AMS and mission-specific processes or
> applications.

## Overview

> A general overview of the required steps follows this sequence:

1. Include the AMS library header file (ams.h) in your application's
   source code
2. Use the provided AMS library functions to implement the interface
   (to include functionality such as publication and subscription)
3. Compile your application and link the compiled binary to the
   required library objects (i.e. ici, dgr, ltp, bp)

## Compiling Custom AMS Applications

> Applications created with the API must be compiled with links to ION's
> dynamic libraries.
>
> The following two-step build procedure provides an example of how this
> works (note that the default path for installed ION library files
> (Linux) is used: /usr/local/lib/):

1. *gcc -g -Wall -Werror -Dlinux -DUDPTS -DTCPTS -DDGRTS -DNOEXPAT
   -fPIC -DSPACE_ORDER=3 -I../library -I../include -I../rams
   -I/usr/local/include -c \<your_module_name\>.c*
2. *gcc -g -Wall -Werror -Dlinux -DUDPTS -DTCPTS -DDGRTS -DNOEXPAT
   -fPIC -DSPACE_ORDER=3 -I../library -I../include -I../rams
   -I/usr/local/include -o \<your_module_name\> \<your_module_name\>.o
   -L./lib -L/usr/local/lib -lams -ldgr -lici -lpthread -lm*

## Running the Application

Applications must self-register with an AMS registrar. To facilitate
this the following information is required by the application (i.e.
using the ams_register() function):

1. unit name
2. role name
3. application name
4. authority name

> Given this requirement, it may be useful (but not necessary) for the
> application to accept command line arguments.
>
> An example command to start a custom AMS module might look like the
> following:
>
> *./your_module_name ' ' your_module_mib_role_name amsdemo test*
>
> Note: the empty quotes (' ') above are used to specify registration
> with the root unit registrar.

# A Sample Application

> Follows is the complete source code for 'amshello', a simple
> Unix-based AMS application installed alongside AMS. It is a complete
> distributed system comprising two AMS application modules that
> functions as follows.
>
> When the amshello program starts it *fork()*s into two processes, a
> "pitcher" and a "catcher". Both processes then register as modules in
> the root cell of an "amsdemo/test" message space. The catcher invites
> messages on subject "text" and waits for the first such message to
> arrive. The pitcher waits for an invitation to send messages of
> subject "text" and, when it arrives, sends one such message and
> terminates. When the catcher receives the message it prints the text
> of the message and then terminates.
>
> To run the 'amshello' demonstration application the following 2 steps
> are required.

1. An AMS configuration server and registrar must be started (do this
   after all other ION processes have started) using the following
   command:*amsd @ @ amsdemo test \"\" &*
2. Then run the amshello application using the following command:
   *amshello*

> Important points regarding the above *amsd* command (see *man amsd*
> for additional details):

- The first '@' character specifies the use of AMS' in-memory MIB
  (used for demonstration purposes only)
- The second '@' character specifies that the daemon will serve as
  both a registrar and configuration server (running at
  127.0.0.1:2357)
- The "" parameter specifies that the registrar function as the "root
  unit" registrar
