# Add an EID scheme.
#	The scheme's name is ipn.
#	The scheme's number is 1.  Note that this number is defined for
#	Compressed Bundle Header Encoding (CBHE) schemes ONLY.  All other
#	schemes (dtn for example) should use number -1.
#	This scheme's forwarding engine is handled by the program 'ipnfw.'
#	This scheme's administration program (acting as the custodian
#	daemon) is 'ipnadminep.'
a scheme ipn 'ipnfw' 'ipnadminep'
a scheme dtn 'dtn2fw' 'dtn2adminep'

# Add endpoints.
#	Establish endpoints ipn:1.1 and ipn:1.2 on the local node.
#	The behavior for receiving a bundle when there is no application
#	currently accepting bundles, is to queue them 'q', as opposed to
#	immediately and silently discarding them (use 'x' instead of 'q' to
#	discard).
a endpoint ipn:1.1 q
a endpoint ipn:1.2 q

a endpoint dtn://host1.dtn x
a endpoint dtn://host1.dtn/a q

# Add a protocol. 
#	Add the protocol named stcp.
#	Estimate transmission capacity assuming 1400 bytes of each frame (in
#	this case, udp on ethernet) for payload, and 100 bytes for overhead.
a protocol stcp 1400 100

# Add an induct. (listen)
#	Add an induct to accept bundles using the stcp protocol.
#	The induct itself is implemented by the 'stcpcli' command.
a induct stcp 127.0.0.1:4556 stcpcli

# Add an outduct. (send to yourself)
#	Add an outduct to send bundles using the stcp protocol.
#	The outduct itself is implemented by the 'stcpclo' command.
