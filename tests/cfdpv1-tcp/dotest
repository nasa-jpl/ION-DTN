# Tests some of the revisions to CCSDS file delivery protocol.
# CFDP is started at both nodes, and a background cfdptest task, which
# only receives and document service indications, is started at both
# nodes.  A cfdptest task is started at node 1, sending a file to node 2.
# Then another cfdptest is started at node 2 which issues a proxy put
# to "get" file from node 2.  Both operations are performed in unacknowledged
# mode with closure requested by the file sender in each direction.
# Communication between the two nodes is subject to 3 seconds of OWLT,
# so the "get" operation should finish before the put operation (which must
# wait for a Finished PDU from node 2).
