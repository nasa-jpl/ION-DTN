<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>ION open source comes with an Excel spreadsheet to help users configure the LTP protocol to optimize performance based on each user's unique use case.</p>
<p>ION's implementation of LTP is challenging to configure: there are a lot
of configuration parameters to set, because the design is intended to
support a very wide variety of deployment scenarios that are optimized
for a variety of different figures of merit (utility metrics).</p>
<p>LTP-ION is managed as a collection of "spans", that is,
transmission/reception relationships between the local LTP engine (the
engine -- or DTN "node" -- that you are configuring) and each other LTP
engine with which the local engine can exchange LTP protocol segments.
Spans are managed using functions defined in libltpP.c that are offered
to the operator by the ltpadmin program.</p>
<p>ltpadmin can be used to add a span, update an existing span, delete a
span, provide current information on a specified span, or list all
spans. The span configuration parameters that must be set when you add
or update a span are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>remote LTP engine number</code> identifying the span. For ION, this
  is by convention the same as the BP node number as established when
  the ION database was initialized.</li>
<li>The <code>maximum number of export sessions</code> that can be held open on
  this span at any one time. This implements LTP flow control across
  the span: since no new data can be transmitted until it is appended
  to a block -- the data to be conveyed in a single export session --
  and no new session can be started until the total number of open
  sessions drops below the maximum, the closure of export sessions
  regulates the rate at which LTP can be used to transmit data.</li>
<li>The <code>maximum number of import sessions</code> that will be open on this
  span at any one time. This value is simply the remote engine's own
  value for the "maximum number of export sessions" parameter.</li>
<li><code>Maximum LTP segment size</code>. This value is typically the maximum
  permitted size of the payload of each link-layer protocol data unit
  -- nominally a <em>frame</em>.</li>
<li><code>Aggregation size limit</code>. This is the "nominal" size for blocks to
  be sent over this span: normally LTP will concatenate multiple
  service data units (such as BP bundles) into a single block until
  the aggregate size of those service data units exceeds the
  aggregation size limit, and only then will it divide the block into
  segments and use the underlying link service to transmit the
  segments. (Note that it is normal for the aggregation size limit to
  be exceeded. In this sense, the word "limit" is really a misnomer;
  "threshold" would be a better term.)</li>
<li><code>Aggregation time limit</code>. This parameter establishes an alternate
  means of terminating block aggregation and initiating segment
  transmission: in the event that service data units are not being
  presented to LTP rapidly enough to promptly fill blocks of nominal
  size, LTP will arbitrarily terminate aggregation when the length of
  time that the oldest service data units in the block have been
  waiting for transmission exceeds the aggregation time limit.</li>
<li><code>The Link Service Output command.</code> This parameter declares the
  command that will be used to start the link service output task for
  this span. The value of this parameter is a string, typically
  enclosed in single quote marks and typically beginning with the name
  of the executable object for the task. When the "udplso" link
  service output module is to be used for a given span, the module
  name is followed by the IPAddress:Port of the remote engine and
  (optionally) the UDP transmission rate limit in bits per second.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, at the time you initialize LTP (normally at the start of
the ltpadmin configuration file) you must set one further configuration
parameter:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Estimated total number of export sessions</code>, for all spans: this
  value is used to size the hash table that LTP uses for storing and
  retrieving export session information.</li>
</ul>
<p>In many cases, the best values for these configuration parameters will
not be obvious to the DTN network administrator. To simplify this task,
an LTP Configuration Worksheet has been developed.</p>
<h2 id="worksheet-overview">Worksheet overview</h2>
<p>The LTP configuration worksheet is designed to aid in the configuration
of a single span -- that is, the worksheet
for the span between engines X and Y will provide configuration
parameter values for use in commanding ltpadmin on both engine X and
engine Y.</p>
<p>The cells of the worksheet are of two general types, <code>Input Cells</code> and
<code>Calculated Cells</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Input Cells</code> are cells in which the network administrator must supply
  values based on project decisions. These cells are yellow-filled.</li>
<li><code>Calculated Cells</code> are cells that are computed by the worksheet based
  on LTP configuration principles. These cells are grey-filled. The
  cells are protected from modification (though you can unprotect them
  if you want by selecting "Unprotect Sheet" on the Excel "Review"
  tab).</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of these cells are used as span configuration parameters or are
figures of merit for network administrators:</p>
<ul>
<li>Span configuration parameters are identified by an adjacent dark
  grey title cell with white text.</li>
<li>Figures of merit for which the network administrator may want to
  optimize the span configuration are identified by an adjacent green
  title cell with red italic text.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Configuration parameters that are described in detail in this
document are numbered. To ease cross referencing between this document
and the worksheet, the parameter numbers are placed next to the title
cells in the worksheet.*</p>
<h2 id="input-parameters">Input Parameters</h2>
<p>This section provides guidance on the values that must be supplied by
the network administrator. Global parameters affect calculated values
and configuration file parameters for all spans involving the local LTP
engine.</p>
<h3 id="global-parameters">Global Parameters</h3>
<p><code>Maximum bit error rate</code> is the maximum bit error rate that the LTP
should provide for in computing the maximum number of transmission
efforts to initiate in the course of transmitting a given block. (Note
that this computation is also sensitive to data segment size and to the
size of the block that is to be transmitted.) The default value is
.000001, i.e., 10^-6^, one uncorrected (but detected) bit error per
million bits transmitted.</p>
<p>The <code>size</code> - estimated size of an LTP report segment in bytes - may vary
slightly depending on the sizes of the session numbers in use. 25 bytes
is a reasonable estimate.</p>
<h3 id="basic-input-parameters">Basic input Parameters</h3>
<p>Values for the following parameters must be provided by the network
administrator in order for the worksheet to guide the configuration.
Values must be provided for both engine "X" and engine "Y".</p>
<ol>
<li>The <code>OWLT</code> between engines (sec) is the maximum one-way light time
   over this span, i.e., the distance between the engines. (Note that
   this value is assumed to be symmetrical.)</li>
<li>A unique <code>engine number</code> for each engine.</li>
<li>The <code>IP address</code> of each engine. (Assuming udplso will be used as the
   link service output daemon.)</li>
<li>The <code>LTP reception port number</code> for each engine. (Again assuming
   udplso will be used as the link service output daemon.)</li>
<li>An estimate of the <code>mean size of the LTP service data units</code>
   (nominally bundles) sent from this engine over this span.</li>
<li><code>Link service overhead</code>. The expected number of bytes of link service
   protocol header information per LTP segment.</li>
<li><code>Aggregation size limit</code> - this is the service data unit aggregation
   size limit for LTP. Note that a suggested
   value for this parameter is automatically computed as described
   below, based on available return channel capacity.</li>
<li>The <code>scheduled transmission rate</code> (in bytes per second) at which this
   engine will transmit data over this span when the two engines are in
   contact.</li>
<li><code>Maximum percentage of channel capacity that may be consumed by LTP report segments</code>. A warning will be displayed if other configuration
   parameters cause this limit to be breached. There are no actual
   mechanism to enforce this limit in ION. This only set in order to
   check the estimated report traffic for the current configuration.
   It is provided as an aid to LTP link designer.</li>
<li>An <code>estimate of the percentage of all data sent over this span that will be red data</code>, i.e., will be subject to positive and negative
   LTP acknowledgment.</li>
<li>
<p><code>Aggregation time limit</code>. The minimum value is 1 second. Increasing
    this limit can marginally reduce the number of blocks transmitted,
    and hence protocol overhead, at times of low communication activity.
    However, it reduces the "responsiveness" of the protocol, increasing
    the maximum possible delay before transmission of any given service
    data unit. (This delay is referred to as "data aggregation
    latency".)</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Low communication activity</code> is defined as a rate of
  presentation of service data to LTP that is less than the
  aggregation size limit divided by the aggregation time limit.</li>
<li><code>LTP segment size</code> (bytes) is the maximum LTP segment size sent over
this span by this engine. Typically, this is the maximum permitted
size of the payloads of link-layer protocol data units (frames).</li>
<li><code>The maximum number of export sessions</code>. This implements a form of
flow control by placing a limit on the number of concurrent LTP
sessions used to transmit blocks. Smaller numbers will result in
slower transmission, while higher numbers increase storage resource
occupancy. Note that a suggested value for this parameter is
automatically computed as described below, based on transmission
rate and one-way light time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="further-guidance">Further Guidance</h2>
<p>This section provides further information on the methods used to compute
the <code>Calculated Cells</code> and also guidance for <code>Input Cell</code> values.</p>
<h3 id="first-order-computed-parameters">First-order Computed Parameters</h3>
<p>The following parameters are automatically computed based on the values
of the basic input parameters.</p>
<ol>
<li><code>Estimated "red" data transmission rate (bytes/sec)</code> is simply the
    scheduled transmission rate multiplied by the estimated "red" data
    percentage.</li>
<li><code>Maximum export data in transit (bytes)</code> is the product of the
    estimated red data transmission rate and the round-trip light time
    (which is twice the one-way light time between the engines). This is
    the maximum amount of red data that cannot yet have been positively
    acknowledged by the remote engine and therefore must be retained in
    storage for possible retransmission.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="configuration-decision-parameters">Configuration decision parameters</h3>
<p>Values for the following parameters must be chosen by the network
administrator on the basis of (a) known project requirements or
preferences. (b) the first-order computed parameters, and (c) the
computed values of figures of merit that result from tentative parameter
value selections, as noted.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>#6 Aggregation size limit</code> (revisited). Reducing this parameter
  tends to increase the number of blocks transmitted, increasing total
  protocol overhead. The suggested value for this parameter is
  computed as follows:</li>
<li>The maximum number of bytes of LTP report content that the remote
  engine may transmit per second is given by the product of the remote
  engine's transmission data rate and the maximum percentage of the
  remote engine's channel capacity that may be allocated to LTP
  reports.</li>
<li>The maximum number of reports per second transmitted by the remote
  engine is the maximum number of LTP report content bytes transmitted
  per second divided by the mean report segment size.</li>
<li>Assuming that normally all blocks are received without error, the
  maximum number of blocks to be transmitted per second by the local
  engine should be equal to the maximum number of reports that may be
  transmitted per second by the remote engine.</li>
<li>
<p>The threshold block size, expressed in bytes per block, is then
  given by dividing the local engine's transmission data rate (in
  bytes per second) by the maximum number of blocks to be transmitted
  per second.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Est. mean export block size</code> is computed as follows:</p>
<p>a.  If the mean service data unit size is so large that aggregation
of multiple service data units into a block is never necessary,
then that mean service data unit size will in effect determine
the mean export block size (one service data unit per block).</p>
<p>b.  Otherwise, the mean export block size will be determined by
aggregation. If the red data transmission rate is so high that
the aggregation time limit will normally never be reached, then
the aggregation size limit constitutes the mean export block
size. Otherwise, block size will be constrained by aggregation
time limit expiration: the estimated mean export block size will
be approximated by multiplying the red data transmission rate by
the number of seconds in the aggregation time limit.</p>
<p>c.  So estimated mean export block size is computed as larger of
mean service data unit size and "expected aggregate block size",
where expected aggregate block size is the lesser of block
aggregation size limit and the product of red data transmission
rate and aggregation time limit.
16. <code>Estimated blocks transmitted per second</code> are computed as <code>Estimated red data xmit rate (bytes/sec)</code> (parameter 13) divided by <code>Est. mean export block size</code> (parameter 15).
17. <code>Est. Report bytes/sec sent</code> by the remote engine in response to these transmitted blocks is computed as the product of <code>Est. blocks transmitted per second</code> (parameter 16) and <code>Size (mean) of LTP acknowledgment (bytes)</code> (a global parameter). When mean service data unit size is less than the aggregation size limit and the red data transmission rate is high enough to prevent the aggregation time limit from ever being reached, this value will be about the same as the maximum number of bytes of LTP report content that the remote engine may transmit per second as computed above.</p>
<p><em>Note: increasing the aggregation size limit reduces the block transmission rate at the local engine, reducing the rate of transmission of acknowledgment data at the remote engine; this can be a significant consideration on highly asymmetrical links.</em>
18. <code>Est. segments per block</code> is computed as <code>Est. mean export block size</code> (parameter 15) divided by <code>LTP segment size (bytes)</code> (parameter 11).
19. <code>Est. LTP delivery efficiency</code> on the span is calculated by dividing <code>Est. blocks delivered per second</code> by <code>Est blocks transmitted per second</code>. Reducing the aggregation size limit indirectly improves delivery efficiency by reducing block size, thus reducing the percentage of transmitted blocks that will be affected by the loss of a given number of frames.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>#12 Maximum number of export sessions (revisited)</code>. Increasing the maximum number of export sessions will tend to improve link bandwidth utilization but will increase the amount of storage space needed for span state retention. The suggested value for this parameter is computed as the <code>maximum export data in transit (bytes)</code> (Parameter 14) divided by <code>Est. mean export block size</code> (parameter 15) as determined above. Configuring the span for a maximum export session count that is less than this limit will make it impossible to fully utilize the link even if all blocks are of estimated mean size.</li>
<li><code>Nominal export SDU's in transit</code> is computed by dividing
<code>Nominal export data in transit (bytes)</code> by the <code>Size (mean) of service data units (bytes)</code> (parameter 4).</li>
<li><code>Expected link utilization</code> is then computed by dividing <code>Nominal export data in transit (bytes)</code> by <code>Maximum export data in transit (bytes)</code> (parameter 14). <strong><em>Note</em></strong> that a low value of expected link utilization indicates that a high percentage of the span's transmission capacity is not being used. Utilization can be improved by increasing estimated mean export block size (e.g., by increasing aggregation size limit) or by increasing the maximum number of export sessions.</li>
<li><code>Max data aggregation latency (sec)</code> is simply the value supplied
for <code>Aggregation time limit (sec)</code> (parameter 10) as this time
limit is never exceeded.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="ltp-initialization-parameters">LTP Initialization Parameters</h3>
<p>Finally, the remaining LTP initialization parameter can be computed when
all span configuration decisions have been made.</p>
<ol>
<li><code>Maximum number of import sessions</code> is automatically taken from
    the remote engine's maximum number of export sessions.</li>
</ol>
<p><em>This research was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
California Institute of Technology, under a contract with the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration.</em></p>
<h2 id="updated-features-may-2021">Updated Features - May 2021</h2>
<p>This section describes the following features added to the configuration
tool as of May 2021:</p>
<ol>
<li>A "link" worksheet has been added to set space link parameters such
   as frame size and error rate and to compute parameters such as
   <em>maxBer</em> and laboratory Ethernet-based frame loss simulation.</li>
<li>Conditional formatting has been added to a few entries in the <em>main</em>
   worksheet to provide visual cues for out-of-range parameters and
   warning messages to guide parameter selection.</li>
<li>A simple model to estimate the minimum required heapWord size for a
   one-hop LTP link.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="link-worksheet">Link Worksheet</h3>
<p>The recommended workflow for using the LTP configuration tool is to
first establish the space link configuration using the <em>link</em> worksheet
before attempting to generate a LTP configuration under the <em>main</em>
worksheet. The <em>link</em> worksheet has the following input and computed
cells:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Select CCSDS Frame Size (bits) \[user input\]--</code> this cell allows
  the user to select a standard CCSDS AOS/TM frame size from a drop
  down list that includes LDPC, Turbo, and Reed-Solomon codes.</li>
<li><code>CCSDS Frame Size (bytes) \[computed\]</code>-- converts frame size from
  bits to bytes.</li>
<li><code>Desired Frame Error Rate \[user input\]</code> -- this parameter sets
  the expected frame error rate of the LTP link in operation. This
  parameter could be derived from link budget analysis or a mission
  requirement document.</li>
<li><code>Segment size (byte) \[user input\]</code> -- this parameter sets the
  maximum segment payload size used by LTP. The size of the segment,
  in relation to the underlying CCSDS frame, will determine the
  segment error rate and the probability that LTP will need to request
  retransmission.</li>
<li><code>Ethernet Frame Size (byte) \[user input\]</code> -- this is the
  Ethernet frame size used in a laboratory environment to simulate
  space link frame losses.</li>
<li><code>Segment Error Rate Computation \[computed\]</code> -- this is the LTP
  segment error rate derived from the frame error rate and the segment
  and CCSDS frame size selections.</li>
<li><code>*maxBER* Computation \[computed\]</code> -- this is the computed
  <em>maxBER</em> parameter for LTP. The <em>maxBER</em> parameter is what LTP uses
  to estimate segment error rate, which in turn will affect how LTP
  handles handshaking failure and repeated retransmission requests. To
  properly operate LTP, the maxBER value provided must result in the
  same segment error rate as one expects to encounter in real space
  link.</li>
<li><code>Ethernet Error Rate Computation \[computed\]</code> -- this is the
  recommended setting for using laboratory Ethernet frame error
  software/hardware to simulate space link loss. This value is
  translated from the segment error rate to Ethernet frame error to
  make sure that laboratory testing provides a statistically
  equivalent impact on LTP.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="enhancements">Enhancements</h3>
<p>In the <em>main</em> worksheet described in Section 3, we made the following
enhancements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Item 6: <code>Aggregation size limit (bytes)</code> -- a green icon is
  displayed when the input parameter is greater or equal to the
  suggested value; a red icon is displayed when this parameter is
  below the suggested value. The suggested value aggregation size
  limit upper bounds the LTP block rate such that the acknowledgement
  traffic (report segments) from the receiver to the sender can be
  supported.</li>
<li>Item 10: <code>Aggregation time limit (sec)</code> -- there are two factors
  affecting LTP block aggregation: time limit and size limit. The
  aggregation process stops as soon as one of the two limits is
  reached. A green icon is displayed if the time limit value in this
  cell is sufficiently large such that the aggregation process will be
  size limited, i.e., on average the LTP block aggregation process
  will reach the size limit before the time limit. This is the nominal
  and desired configuration unless there is a strict latency
  requirement that forces one to use a very low aggregation time
  limit. A red icon is displayed if the time limit will be driving,
  which means the LTP block size will generally be smaller than the
  aggregation size limit and the block rate will be higher than
  desired. If a latency requirement forces the use of a low
  aggregation time limit, one must check to make sure there is still
  sufficient bandwidth to support the acknowledgement (report segment)
  traffic.</li>
<li>Item 17: <code>Est. report bytes/sec sent</code> - this field estimates the
  bandwidth required to support LTP report segment traffic up to 95
  percentile of all cases involving retransmission of missing
  segments. The segment error rate was derived from the <em>link</em>
  worksheet. The green icon indicates that estimated report bandwidth
  is feasible based on current configuration.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="heapword-size-estimate">HeapWord Size Estimate</h3>
<p>A simple HeapWord size estimate calculation is added to the <em>main</em>
worksheet, based on the following assumptions:</p>
<ol>
<li>The only traffic flows in the system are those between node X and Y
   using LTP.</li>
<li>Heap is sized to support at least 1 contact session</li>
<li>Each contact starts with a clean slate. At the beginning of a
   contact, the heap space is not occupied by bundles/blocks/segments
   left over from previous contact or other unfinished processes.</li>
<li>Source user data is file-resident. Most ION test utility programs
   such as <em>bpsendfile</em> and <em>bpdriver</em> will keep source data (or create
   simulated data) in a file for as long as possible until just prior
   to transmission by the underlying convergence layer adaptor when
   pieces of user data are copied into each out-going convergence
   layer's PDUs. Please check how your software uses the BP API to
   determine how source data is handled. If in doubt, you may need to
   increase the heap space allocation to hold the user's source data.</li>
<li>Aggregated LTP blocks are size-limited (not time-limited).</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="user-input">User Input:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Item 24: <code>Longest Expected Period to Buffer Data Period (sec)</code> --
  this is the expected longest period of time one expects ION will
  buffer user data. The data accumulation rate is the same as the LTP
  red data data rate.</li>
<li>Item 25: <code>(32/64) bit system</code> -- this is platform dependent
  parameter. Heap space is specified in the number of words. For a
  32-bit system, each word has 32 bits; for a 64-bit system, each word
  has 64 bits.</li>
<li>Item 26: <code>Additional Margin</code> -- adds more margin to the model per
  user's discretion</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="model-output">Model Output:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Item 27: <code>Recommended heapWords value (with 40% for ZCO)</code> -- this
  is the suggested <code>heapWords</code> value for <code>ionconfig</code>.</li>
<li>Item28: <code>Recommended heapWords value - iif source data completely in memory</code> -- this is the suggested <code>heapWords</code> value for
  <em>ionconfig</em> assuming the source data is copied into heap space at
  the time of bundle creation without using file-resident reference.</li>
<li>Item 29: <code>wmSize recommendation</code> - this is the suggested <code>wmSize</code>
  parameter to use to support the staging of large quantities of
  bundles in the heap. This recommended value includes an additional
  200% margin. The rationale for the calculation is derived from
  analysis summarized in the <code>ION Deployment Guide</code> and based on
  previous studies.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="appendix">Appendix</h2>
<h3 id="bpltp-memory-usage-analysis-summary">BP/LTP Memory Usage Analysis Summary</h3>
<p>In this section, we summarize the finding documented in a powerpoint
presentation titled, "ION DTN/LTP Configuration and ION Memory Usage
Analysis", dated January 2021, that is used as the basis for estimating
the heap space required for BP/LTP operation in ION:</p>
<ul>
<li>When using file-resident data to conduct tests (e.g., bpdriver,
  bpsendfile, etc) the heap space holds mostly the header information
  in the data structure.</li>
<li>
<p>With 1 bundle in the system that is under active LTP session, the
  minimum heap space needed can be approximated as: <em>heap space</em> =
  <em>S</em> + <em>base</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>S</em> is the bundle size / segment size x segment header size x 10</p>
</li>
<li>The segment header is approximated to be 19 bytes</li>
<li><em>Base</em> is the default usage at initial boot, before any bundles
    were generated. In our experiment, it is approximately 48
    Kilobyte.</li>
<li>Let M equal the number of bundles that fits within TWLT-bandwidth
  product, and</li>
<li>Assume that the max_export_session &gt; M so efficiency can be
  maximized, then</li>
<li>For a burst of N bundles to be buffered in ION:</li>
<li>
<p>If N \&lt;= M, heap space usage is approximately S x N + 1560 bytes x
  N + base</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>S x N is LTP related heap usage, 1560 x N is bundle level heap
    usage</p>
</li>
<li>"1560 bytes" is an empirical estimate based on test
    observations. It is the additional heap space needed to
    accommodate each additional bundle structure and also a small
    amount of data as determined by the heapmax parameter in .bprc
    file (default value is 650 bytes).</li>
<li>
<p>If N &gt; M, heap space usage is approximately S x M + 1560 bytes x
  N + base</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For bundle in LTP transmission, we count both LTP and bundle
    level heap usage</p>
</li>
<li>Apply additional margin on the estimated heap space should
  accommodate:</li>
<li>The available heap space for storing inbound and outbound bundle
  data is only 40% of the total heap space (determined by heapWords in
  .ionconfig file)</li>
</ul>
