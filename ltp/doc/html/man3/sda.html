<p>sda - LTP Service Data Aggregation (SDA) library</p>

<h1 id="SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</h1>

<pre><code>    #include &quot;sda.h&quot;

    typedef vast (*SdaDelimiterFn)(unsigned int clientId, unsigned char *buffer, vast bufferLength);

    typedef int (*SdaHandlerFn)(uvast sourceEngineId, unsigned int clientId, Object clientServiceData);

    [see description for available functions]</code></pre>

<h1 id="DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</h1>

<p>The <b>sda</b> library provides functions enabling application software to use LTP more efficiently, by aggregating multiple small client service data units into larger LTP client service data items. This reduces overhead somewhat, but more importantly it reduces the volume of positive and negative LTP acknowledgment traffic by sending more data in fewer LTP blocks -- because LTP acknowledgments are issued on a per-block basis.</p>

<p>The library relies on the application to detect the boundaries between aggregated service data units in each received LTP client service data item; the application must provide an SdaDelimiterFn function for this purpose. An SDA delimiter function inspects the client service data bytes in <i>buffer</i> - some portion of an LTP service data block, of length <i>bufferLength</i> - to determine the length of the client service data unit at the start of the buffer; data unit client service ID is provided to aid in this determination. The function returns that length if the determination was successful, zero if there is no valid client service data item at the start of the buffer, -1 on any system failure.</p>

<p>The <b>sda</b> library similarly relies on the application to process the service data units identified in this manner; the application must provide an SdaHandlerFn function for this purpose. An SDA handler function is provided with the ID of the LTP engine that sent the service data unit, the client ID characterizing the service data unit, and the service data unit itself; the service data unit is presented as a Zero-Copy Object (ZCO). The handler function must return -1 on any system error, zero otherwise.</p>

<dl>

<dt id="int-sda_send-uvast-destinationEngineId-unsigned-int-clientId-Object-clientServiceData">int sda_send(uvast destinationEngineId, unsigned int clientId, Object clientServiceData);</dt>
<dd>

<p>Sends a client service data unit to an application, identified by <i>clientId</i>, at the LTP engine identified by <i>destinationEngineId</i>. clientServiceData must be a &quot;zero-copy object&quot; reference as returned by ionCreateZco(). Note that SDA will privately make and destroy its own reference to the client service data; the application is free to destroy its reference at any time. Note that the client service data unit will always be sent reliably (i.e., &quot;red&quot;).</p>

<p>Also note that sda_run() must be executing in order for sda_send to be performed.</p>

<p>Returns 0 on success, -1 on any system failure.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="int-sda_run-SdaDelimiterFn-delimiter-SdaHandlerFn-handler">int sda_run(SdaDelimiterFn delimiter, SdaHandlerFn handler);</dt>
<dd>

<p>sda_run() executes an infinite loop that receives LTP client service data items, calls <i>delimiter</i> to determine the length of each client service data unit in each item, and passes those client service data units to the <i>handler</i> function. To terminate the loop, call sda_interrupt(). Note that sda_send() can only be executed while the sda_run() loop is still executing.</p>

<p>Returns 0 on success, -1 on any system failure.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="void-sda_interrupt">void sda_interrupt();</dt>
<dd>

<p>Interrupts sda_run().</p>
